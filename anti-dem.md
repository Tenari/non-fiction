# Democracy is Evil

## Foreword

Some of these proofs are stronger than other. Any given proposition can be debated to some extent. However, taken as a whole, the case appears to me to be quite strong. Obviously *I* think it's good, I wrote it, after all. I would ask that you consider the case as emotionlessly as possible. Many of us love our government, and no one wants to feel that he loves evil. However, it behoves anyone with intellectual honesty to at least consider the possibility that he might be in the wrong. Some very smart men were, after all, Nazis.

"Democracy is the worst, except for all the others," is the frequent rejoinder from defenders of democracy who have heard my critique. I'll not dispute the claim here, but merely point out, that if it truly is the best form of government, AND if all I say below is true, then it should be easy--nay, trivial--to support the claim that "Monarchy is evil," and it should be possible, though not necessarily easy to support the claim that "Monarchy is more evil than Democracy." I leave doing so as an exercise to the reader.

## Proofs

**Theorem: Democracy is evil**

Proof:
1. *Democracy* is a *form of government*.
2. A *form of government* is evil if it is the general rule that actual or historical *governments* claiming to be an instance of the form are evil.
    - It is not necessary that every single implementation of the form is evil, merely that the "prime" examples of the form are evil.
3. A *government* is the group of people who rule a country.
4. A government is evil if it inflicts evil on its citizens.
5. The United States Government (*USG*), both current and historical, is the foremost example of democracy.
6. By the combination of #5 and #2, *Democracy* is evil if the *USG* is evil.
7. The USG inflicts evil on its citizens in the following ways:
    1. By [influencing its citizens to become more evil themselves.](#proof-of-7-i)
    2. By [directly, and unjustly harming its citizens.](#proof-of-7-ii)
    3. [Failing to fullfill its God-ordained role.](#proof-of-7-iii)
8. By the combination of #4 and #7, the *USG* is an evil government.
9. By the combination of #6 and #8, *Democracy is evil*.

QED

### Proof of #7-i

- The USG influences its citizens to become more evil themselves in the following ways:
    1. Encourages them to [*abandon their God*.](#proof-of-7-i-i)
    2. Inflames their *pride* and *envy*.
    3. Tempts them to *greed*.
    4. Creates excuses for their *gluttony*.
    5. Fosters a spirit of *wrath* in the political losers.
    6. Failing to eradicate the evils which promote *lust*.
    7. Enabling *sloth*.

### Proof of #7-ii

- The USG directly and unjustly harms its citizens by:
    1. Setting itself up as their god.
    2. Denigrating their fathers and mothers.
    3. Declaring unjust wars.
    4. Wasting their money.
    5. Lying to them.

### Proof of #7-iii

- The role of goverment is to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. (Romans 13:4)
- The USG fails to fullfill the role of goverment by:
    1. Allowing a great many sins to flower without fear of punishment.
    2. Punishing those who have committed no wrong.
    3. Punishing certain crimes far out of proportion to justice.
    4. Making so many laws so as to imply that all must be punished.

### Proof of #7-i-i

- The USG encourages its citizens to abandon their God because:
    1. In practice, its citizens *have* abandoned their God, implying that their government played a role.
        1. At its founding, the nation was for all practical purposes 100% Christian (mostly of the Protestant sects).
        2. At the current time, only ~66% of the population is nominally Christian of any kind.
        3. A large portion of the nominal population is non-practicing.
        4. #2 and #3 imply that only a minority of citizens are practicing Christians. (wikipedia lists only 19% of American Christians as "Active Christians)
    2. It promotes the "Separation of Church and State" which naturally tends to dimish the importance of the Church, rather than the importance of the State.
    3. The USG is founded on the premise of liberalism, also called "progress," which is directly antagonistic towards tradition, a key tenet of religion.
    4. The USG celebrates and encourages many other vices in its citizens, which helps them to abandon their God.

### Proof of #7-i-ii

- Common propositions:
    1. The USG promotes the idea that all its citizens are "equal."
    2. All men are manifestly *not* equal in any way.
- The USG inflames the *pride* of its citizens.
    1. By common propositions #1 and #2, its citizens will come to hold a false view of their own *value*.
    2. *Pride* is the excessive love of one's own *excellence*.
    3. By the law of averages and #1, many citizens will over-estimate their own *value*.
    4. "Excessive love of one's own excellence" and "over-estimating one's own value" are functionally identical.
    5. By #3 and #4, the USG inflames the *pride* of its citizens.

    QED
- The USG inflames the envy of its citizens.
    1. Envy is a sorrow which one entertains at another's fortune because of a view that one's own excellence is in consequence lessened.
    2. By common propositions #1 and #2, many citizens will see the realities of inequality as something bad.
    3. A reality of inequality is that some men are more fortunate than others.
    4. By #2 and #3, many men will come to see good things in others as being bad.
    5. By #4 and human nature, many men will come to entertain a sorrow at another's fortune.
    6. By #5 and the law of averages, some men will come to entertain a sorrow at another's fortune, because of the view that their own excellence is lessened.

    QED

### Proof of #7.1.3
- The USG tempts its citizens to *greed*.
    1. *Greed* is the inordinate love for riches.
    2. Men love that which their society exalts.
    3. 

### Proof of #7.1.4
- The USG excuses its citizens' gluttony.
    1.

### Proof of #7.1.5
- The USG fosters a spirit of wrath in the political losers of its citizens.
    1.

### Proof of #7.1.6
- The USG fails to eradicate the evils which promote lust.
    1.

### Proof of #7.1.7
- The USG enables sloth in its citizens.
    1.

What follows is my original attempt at a proof.

Democracy is a form of government. I posit that a form of government is evil if either:
1. its theoretical implementation implies an evil government
or
2. its historic actual implementations have largely been evil.

A government is the group of people who rule a country. I posit that any given government is evil if:
1. it causes or promotes evil among its citizens (i.e. citizens of the government themselves become evil because of their government's influence)
or
2. it inflicts evil upon its citizens directly
or
3. it inflicts evil upon its neighboring governments

Therefore, I need only show that one point from both lists is true, to show that democracy is evil. However, the case against democracy is so strong that I will endeavor to show that all points in each list is true of democracy.

"Democracy" literally means "rule of the people." Because of the logistical complications of direct democracy, representative democracy is generally what is meant when people say "democracy," so that is what I will discuss, but most if not all of the arguments that follow apply to either form.

The theoretical implemention of democracy is where regular elections are held, in which the citizenry elect representatives who run the country. Therefore the government in a theoretical democracy is composed entirely of officials who are elected (with the possible exception for the offices that are appointed by the representatives). There are many variations on this central theme, adding in features like a balance of powers, separate branches, etc. However, this core feature is essential to democracy and represents the idea in its simplest form. If you need a succint image to understand what a democracy is, the "spoils system" and "elections" should suffice.

What about this theoretical governemnt implies evil?

1. it necessarily causes and promotes evil among its citizens by inflaming the pride and envy of its citizenry, by tempting its citizenry to greed, by creating excuses for its citizen's gluttony, and by fostering a spirit of wrath in the losing factions of its citizenry.

2. It will inflict evil upon its citizen directly by commiting theft, by promoting lies, and by unjust use of violence.

Negative effects among the citizens:

Pride:
That all citizens recieve an "equal" vote is inherent in the form of democracy. This political falsehood--for all men are manifestly UN-equal in nearly every way, particularly in how much their opinion on the workings of goverment should matter--will natrually elevate a false view of the importance any individual citizen has, which is almost the definition of pride.

Envy:


Greed:


Gluttony:


Wrath:
Elections have winners and losers. Losers naturally feel angry. Anger can easily manifest as wrath. Therefore Elections foster a spirit of wrath.

Direct evil to the citizens:

Theft:
Because elected representatives have no guarantee of remaining in office for long, they have a structural incentive to steal from their citizens and enrich themselves while they have the opportunity to do so. That few would state it so plainly does not change the fact that a democracy implies a spoils system, and the spoils are stolen from the citizens, by the government.

Lies:


Violence:

==

However, implementations of the theoretical template for democracy are not long for this world, and are soon replaced by systems which merely masquerade as a democracy, such as is present in the United States of America. That is to say, not only are "true democracies" theoretically evil, but also "false democracies" are evil in theory.

False democracies are characterized by a divorce of the formal levers of goverment power and the actual levers of government power. If the elected representatives are the goverment of a true democracy, then the permament "civil service" is the goverment of a false democracy. For any unfamiliar with the concept that modern "democracies" might be democracies in name only, I suggest reading a little moldbug.

What about the idea of a false democracy implies that any actual implementation of it must be evil?

1. it necessarily causes and promotes much the same sorts of evil among its citizens as a true democracy, however the mechanism for each is distinct.

2. It will inflict evil upon its citizens by promoting lies, unjust use of violence, and commiting theft. (ordered by general magnitude of effect)

3. It will be inclined to inflict evil up on its neighboring goverments primarily by the instigation of unjust wars, and secondarily by undermining the principles of legitimacy of its neighbors.

So, basically, false democracies are like true democracies, but worse, because they can survive much longer and grow much bigger.
