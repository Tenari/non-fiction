All Protestants should join the Catholic Church

1. Christians are members of the Church, which was established by Jesus and his disciples.
2. The Church is the company of all Christians regarded as a spiritual body.
3. No spiritual body can function properly when its various members regard each other as false, or not a part of the body.
4. Thus if the Church is to function properly, its members must regard each other as a part of the same body.
5. Protestants and Catholics generally do not regard each other as part of the same body. 
7. Thus if the Church is to function properly, Protestants and Catholics must merge to become one body.
8. If a group splits, where one side of the split does not want the split to occur, and the other does, then one side is the original, and the other is the rebel.
9. Protestants desired to establish their own, distinct body, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Protestants are the rebels.
10. Catholics desired to keep Protestants together, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Catholics are the original.
11. When two groups merge, if one is the original, and one is the rebel, the rebel must submit to the original. This is called Repentance.
12. Thus, if Protestants and Catholics must merge, Protestants must submit to Catholics, in repentance.
13. By #7 and #12, if the Church is to function properly, Protestants must submit to Catholics in repentance.
14. All Protestants should desire the Church to function properly.
15. Thus all Protestants should join the Catholic Church.

# To show that the Catholic Church is the one true bride of Christ

(stolen from Peter Kreeft)

### Proof from herself

1. The Catholic Church claims to be the unique, infallible authority that Christ instituted on earth.
2. This is either true, or false.
3. It is not intrinsically impossible, in the way a round square is, so it might be true.
4. If the Catholic Church's claims about herself are true, then it is the duty of all Christians to bow to her authority and follow her commands.
5. If the Catholic Church's claims about herself are false, then it is the duty of all Christians to attack her as a usurper of the authority and honor due to Christ.
6. 

(mostly stolen/rephrased from [John C Wright](http://www.scifiwright.com/apologetics/))

### Proof from authority

1. Christians hold that a man called Christ lived and died and lived again around the year 30.
2. The evidence that #1 is true comes almost entirely from the testimony of the magesterium of the Catholic Church.
3. Thus to be a Christian, but to reject the magesterium is irrational, since you must believe something based on the testimony of an entity whose witness you do not respect.
4. Thus to be a rational Christian, you must accept the testimony of the magesterium.

In effect, the Lutheran claim is a claim of the right to rebel against the teaching authority of the Church, on the grounds that the Church is apostate. Unfortunately, the sole witness for the apostasy of the Church is an alleged disagreement between Church teachings and the scriptures on which the Church relies for those teachings.

But the sole witness for the validity, canonicity, historicity, and divinity those selfsame scriptures is the authority of the Church whose members wrote them, gathered, sanctified, protected, promulgated and canonized them.

The Protestants make a similar claim for the body of the congregation, or for the written message, or for each individual reading it. No matter how unbelievable the claim is that the king sent an invisible spirit to protect the messengers from error, while it is logically possible that one messenger has this authority, is not logically possible, from the simple fact that all the messengers disagree, that they all possess it.

### Proof from canonicity

1. Christians hold the doctrines of the Incarnation and the Trinity.
2. The Catholic Church, and its Ecumenical Councils, is the sole authority on which those doctrines rest.
3. To accept the doctrines in a rational way, requires accepting the authority of the Church who pronounced them.

Historically again, the final canon of the Bible was not established shortly after the messengers set out, but somewhere around the 500 A.D., after those first few Ecumenical Councils whose decision the Protestants accept, but whose authority they do not accept. And yet everything which the Protestants reject as corruptions, from the anointment of bishops to the consecration of the host to the adoration of Mary to prayers for the dead, are between one to four centuries older than that date, and there is no surviving record of any Christian ever doing things any other way.

### Proof from magisterium

1. Christians hold that the Bible is infallible.
2. The Catholic Church assembled the Bible, determining what was and was not scripture.
3. For any assembled thing to be infallible, it must be assembled by something infallible.
4. Thus if the Bible is infallible, the Church who assembled it must also be infallible.
5. Thus Christians who hold that the Bible is infallible must also hold that the Catholic Church is infallible.

Fifth, there is the causal argument. A fallible cause cannot produce an infallible effect. But the Church is the efficient cause of Scripture. She wrote it. She is also its formal cause: She defined its canon. Thus, if the Church is only fallible, Scripture is only fallible. So again your sola scriptura doctrine demeans the authority of the very Scripture you want to exalt.

### Proof from scriptural authority

1. 

Also, the redacted sections of the written message provide a logically insurmountable paradox for the Protestant messengers. If their sole authority for the authenticity of their message is the written part of the message, then they have no authority to redact or remove parts of the message on any grounds. They cannot throw away the Book of the Maccabeus or Tobit or the Letters of James or anything else because they claim that neither they nor anyone has the authority to define the cannon.

### Proof from unity

1. Christ founded a single unified Church.
2. Christ commanded obedience from his followers.
3. To rebel against the Church Christ founded is to disobey Christ.
4. Any group which split off from the unified Church which Christ founded is disobedient.
5. All denominations now existing either split off from the Catholic Church, or are unified to the Catholic Church.
6. Thus the Catholic Church is the unified Church which Christ founded, and which his followers should obey.

### Proof from communion

1. Christ commanded his followers to eat his body and drink his blood.
2. The apostles and immediate followers of the early church understood this to be a literal command, which they followed in the Eucharist.
3. Groups denying the presence of Christ in the Eucharist were always branded heretics and subject to Church discipline.
4. Because it has always been heretical, it is still heretical to deny Christ's presence in the Eucharist.
5. Christians wishing to obey Christ's command, should enter into a Church which has the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
6. Only the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church have the Eucharist.
7. Christians should enter the Catholic Church. (or Orthodox if you really have to)

### Proof from continuity

1. Christ instituted eternal truths for his followers.
2. These eternal truths cannot reverse, by the meaning of "eternal."
3. There are churches whose truths have reversed, and Churches whose truths have not reversed.
4. Churches whose truths have reversed, have violated the eternal and unchanging nature of the Truth Christ revealed.
5. The Catholic Church has not changed her dogmas, only (in a rather limited fashion) has she changed her prudential practices.

### Proof from chastity

1. Christ forbade divorce. (Mark 10:9)
2. Many churches calling themselved Christian believe divorce is acceptable.
3. The Catholic Church does not allow divorce.

### Proof from historicity

1. It is possible that the Catholic Church was at one point a valid, Christian authority that all should submit to, but then became corrupted and lost that authority such that a break with the Church was necessary.
2. There must be some point in time when this authority was lost.
3. The point in time is not assignable in a rational way.
4. Thus the Catholic Church never lost the authority she had from the beginning.

### Proof from ignorance of history

1. The Catholic Church is richly historical.
2. Knowledge of, and veneration for history is important in order for the Church Christ founded to grow.
3. Denominations other than the Catholic Church are naturally ahistorical.
4. Thus denominations other than the Catholic Church cannot grow properly, and are corrupted or stunted.
5. The Catholic Church does not have this flaw, and can truly grow and develop as Christ intended.

1. A lack of history implies a lack of tradition.
2. Tradition and connection to the past is necessary for the Church to remain true the the revelation she has received.

### Proof from heresy

1. Heresies are always simplifications of a complex and interdependent organism of ideas into a single master idea.
2. Upon examination, all non-Catholic denominations fit the simplification pattern of heresy.
  1. lacking some (or all) of the seven sacraments
  2. historical ignorance
  3. missing hierarchical governance
3. By default, the only non-heretical church remaining is the Catholic Church.

### Proof from balanced judgement

### Proof from false accusations

### Proof from sacramental life

#### Proof that Protestants are the false Church

The Lutherans were not being completely arbitrary, but neither was the argument being made in good faith, since one of the points of dispute between Luther and the Catholic Church was the legitimacy of prayers for the dead, which logically implies a purgatory or other intermediate condition aside from heaven or hell. The Book of Maccabeus contains references to Jews praying for the dead. The theologian who argues that scripture is the sole and sufficient source of all learning needed for salvation conveniently leaves out the scriptures that disagree with his pet theories.


#### Discussion on first proof

Objection:

> Questions on 3: why do christians _need_ to regard each other as anything? Could one not go off in solitude or in a small group to lead their christian lives?
> Question on the whole thing: Does this assume the immutability of the Catholic church? Could not it have deviated from Jesus's founding doctrine and thus the Protestants returned to that in their split? (I don't think that's what happened, but it could be worth a clarification).
> That is, *IF* the Catholic church had gone astray, would it be an option to split? Or is internal reform the only path?

Reply:

> it is true that the orthodox church esp in russia, but even some church fathers like Jerome, would go off in solitude as hermits to worship God
> but I think this kind of activity is best understood as a temporary "trial in the wilderness" like what Jesus went through when he was tempted, or what the prophet Elijah did after he killed all the priests of Baal
> given my definition of a "Church" in #2, the idea of an entirely "loose and separate" Christianity that is not practiced communally... just doesn't make much sense.
> this does assume the immutability of the Catholic Church
> but I also think that even if you assume that the Church had become wholly corrupted
> you would not have a good case for splitting it
> because in order to split and found your own church, you need the authority to do that
> and that authority can only 1. come personally from God, which no protestants claim (except the Mormons) OR 2. be passed down through the existing church hierarchy which has the delegated authority of Christ.
> But if that delegated authority were dissapated through corruption, it would just be lost
> you still would not have the right to form your own Church
> I do not believe in the right of rebellion on any level but the personal level
> ie, you are allowed to rebel personally from specific commands from an immediate superior that contradict more important commands from a higher superior
> but you must accept the personal consequenses fo such
> and continue to acknowldge the lower authority as a rightful authority even when they order you to do something wrong.

#### Question form

1. Are you a Christian?
2. Should Christians want to be in the presense of Jesus?
3. If a large and ancient denomination of Christianity claims to have the Real Presence of Jesus, does that claim merit further study?
4. 

Which did Jesus Christ found on earth before He ascended into heaven: a unified body called the Church, or a unified scripture called the Bible?

Does your church anoint the sick with oil, as James 5:14-15 commands?

Has a woman in your church ever prayed with a veil, as Paul commands in 1 Corinthians 11:1-16?

How can the prayers of one cause the forgiveness of the sins of another, as James 5:14-15 says?

Did Christ come to abolish the law, or fulfill it?
Did the law create a priesthood?
Does your denomination have a priesthood, or have you abolished it?

Why do you accept the Protestant biblical cannon instead of the Catholic, or Orthodox cannon? Are you accepting it because it is the tradition you inherited?

If the Holy Spirit is guiding the interpretation and teaching of a particular group of people, would that group reverse theological teaching?
Which group of humans has the longest history of unreversed theology: Protestants or Catholics?

Do you follow the literal interpretation of the Bible, but think it is only symbolically Christ's body and blood in the bread and wine? Why make that exception?

---

Which group of humans is most responsible for the compilation and promulgation of the Bible: Clear Lake Bible Church, or the Catholic Church?

If you think the church is teaching error, do you have the right to leave and found a new one?
  If not, how can you be a part of any denomination founded as a breakaway response to error?
  If so, why did Christ command those who would not listen to the church to be cast out as punishment? (Matthew 18:15-18) How can church discipline have any meaning at all?

Do you call Mary "blessed" like Elizabeth did, and like Mary's song says all generations will? Do you actually call her that with your mouth?

1 Cor 11:27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.
Have you ever refrained from eating the bread or drinking the cup, for fear of profaining the body and blood of the Lord?

Who understood the meaning of the Eucharist better, the apostles and those they taught, or visionary theologians more than a thousand years later?

Is Christianity a naturally historical religion, founded on a historical man, in a real place and time, who really died and rose again?
Which denomination is more naturally historical, the Catholic Church, or a generic Protestant non-denominational denomination?

Did Christ say that miracles would accompany his messengers?
Which denomination has the most documented evidence of miracles?

Did Christ found a church that was for all peoples and nations, temperments and traditions?
Which church has within it the most variation of practice? Which church has mystics and logicians and charismatic miracle workers and reserved reverential meditators? The Austin Stone, or the Catholic Church?

If Christ intended for his followers to listen to the written scriptures alone, then why did he come at a time when so few men could read? Was his message only for the literate elite for the first 1600 years?

Is the Bible so unambiguously clear that no two men could approach it honestly in good faith and disagree as to its meaning?
If so, why do so many disagree about its meaning? Are all who disagree with you really dishonest in their interpretation?
If not, who can know which interpretation is correct without an authority to guide them?

Why does James say "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone." and "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead." if all we need is faith?

Why does your denomination permit divorce if Christ said "What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."?

Were the fruits of the Reformation peace and goodwill among men, or war, strife, and division?

Did Luther have the right to declare non-canonical the books of the Bible that referenced prayers for the dead, and then teach that prayers for the dead are to no avail?

Luke 20:37-38
But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to him.
If all live to God, if the resurrection from the dead is real, why scorn prayers for the dead? Are they not truly alive in heaven, to hear and take your prayers to God?

1 Corinthians 7:6-8
I say this by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own special gift from God, one of one kind and one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain single as I do.
Where is the place in your denomination for those who wish to "remain single" like St Paul? Do you have monasteries or a priesthood for them to join others pursuing holiness in the same manner as themselves?

How much does it matter which denomination of Church you go to?

Is "How much does it matter which denomination of Church you go to?" an important question?

---

> My point was that don't believe that having a billion children without the capacity to attend to them is loving God. As well as denying sex to your wife is also not loving God when we have the technology to
> I.e. contraception not bad

Are children not "a gift of the LORD" (Psalm 127:3)? Are not grandchildren "the crown of old men"? Is not "the glory of sons" "their fathers"? (Proverbs 17:6) Do you disagree that "Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are children born in one’s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them"? (Psalm 127:4-5)

Moreover, since the human soul is immaterial, does it not require special action on the part of God to create each one of us?

Furthermore, there is no requirement that you have "a billion children." There is no requirement that you marry. When married, there is no requirement that you have sex during the fertile periods of the month.

You and the Church are agreed that no one should have more children than he can handle.

However, you and the Church are disagreed as to what methods may be employed to reach an otherwise good end. The ends do NOT justify the means. There are some means that are wrong. Contraception is one. It is not just me you are arguing with. You are arguing with every major church figure from the time of Christ until the last ~100 years.


> We can never know exactly what decision and action will bring the most glory to God

Agreed

> But as we continue our walk with God
> We will get better at knowing
> As we become more like him
> And that is how we love God

Agreed that we get better at knowing how to please God, and more importantly, we get better at actually doing it, as we grow closer to him, because we become more like him.

But I do not agree that we will somehow become able to know "what decision and action will bring the most glory to God." That is an impossible knowledge problem. Only miraculous knowledge could attain that, and I know of no Bible verse which promises such miraculous knowledge.

And becomeing more like Jesus is indeed how we love God. But what was Jesus like? He did "the will of Him who sent" him. So as we become more like God, we conform ourselves more to God's will. Fortunately, God's will is not entirely nebulous and inscrutable. He has revealed himself to us and given many commands. Moreover, he has given us earthly shepherds to guide us. So on a more specific and practical level, we love God by obeying the commands of God, and the commands of those God has delegated his authority to.

# Catholic Verses

Here is a long list of verses that, in my mind, are clearly supportive of Catholic doctrine and practice, over and above typical American "bible-believing Christian" (non-denomintional) doctrine and practice.

John 3:5              - Catholic doctrine of the saving power of Baptism
1 Corinthians 11:1-16 - Catholic practice of veil wearing during Mass
James 2:14-26         - Catholic doctrine that we are NOT justified by faith alone
James 5:14            - Catholic sacrament of annointing the sick (last rites)
James 5:15-16         - Catholic sacrament of confession
1 Peter 3:20-21       - Catholic doctrine of the saving power of Baptism
rev 21:27
