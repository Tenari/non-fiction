All Protestants should join the Catholic Church

1. Christians are members of the Church, which was established by Jesus and his disciples.
2. The Church is the company of all Christians regarded as a spiritual body.
3. No spiritual body can function properly when its various members regard each other as false, or not a part of the body.
4. Thus if the Church is to function properly, its members must regard each other as a part of the same body.
5. Protestants and Catholics generally do not regard each other as part of the same body. 
7. Thus if the Church is to function properly, Protestants and Catholics must merge to become one body.
8. If a group splits, where one side of the split does not want the split to occur, and the other does, then one side is the original, and the other is the rebel.
9. Protestants desired to establish their own, distinct body, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Protestants are the rebels.
10. Catholics desired to keep Protestants together, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Catholics are the original.
11. When two groups merge, if one is the original, and one is the rebel, the rebel must submit to the original. This is called Repentance.
12. Thus, if Protestants and Catholics must merge, Protestants must submit to Catholics, in repentance.
13. By #7 and #12, if the Church is to function properly, Protestants must submit to Catholics in repentance.
14. All Protestants should desire the Church to function properly.
15. Thus all Protestants should join the Catholic Church.

# To show that the Catholic Church is the one true bride of Christ

(stolen from Peter Kreeft)

### Proof from herself

1. The Catholic Church claims to be the unique, infallible authority that Christ instituted on earth.
2. This is either true, or false.
3. It is not intrinsically impossible, in the way a round square is, so it might be true.
4. If the Catholic Church's claims about herself are true, then it is the duty of all Christians to bow to her authority and follow her commands.
5. If the Catholic Church's claims about herself are false, then it is the duty of all Christians to attack her as a usurper of the authority and honor due to Christ.
6. 

(mostly stolen/rephrased from [John C Wright](http://www.scifiwright.com/apologetics/))

### Proof from authority

1. Christians hold that a man called Christ lived and died and lived again around the year 30.
2. The evidence that #1 is true comes almost entirely from the testimony of the magesterium of the Catholic Church.
3. Thus to be a Christian, but to reject the magesterium is irrational, since you must believe something based on the testimony of an entity whose witness you do not respect.
4. Thus to be a rational Christian, you must accept the testimony of the magesterium.

In effect, the Lutheran claim is a claim of the right to rebel against the teaching authority of the Church, on the grounds that the Church is apostate. Unfortunately, the sole witness for the apostasy of the Church is an alleged disagreement between Church teachings and the scriptures on which the Church relies for those teachings.

But the sole witness for the validity, canonicity, historicity, and divinity those selfsame scriptures is the authority of the Church whose members wrote them, gathered, sanctified, protected, promulgated and canonized them.

The Protestants make a similar claim for the body of the congregation, or for the written message, or for each individual reading it. No matter how unbelievable the claim is that the king sent an invisible spirit to protect the messengers from error, while it is logically possible that one messenger has this authority, is not logically possible, from the simple fact that all the messengers disagree, that they all possess it.

### Proof from canonicity

1. Christians hold the doctrines of the Incarnation and the Trinity.
2. The Catholic Church, and its Ecumenical Councils, is the sole authority on which those doctrines rest.
3. To accept the doctrines in a rational way, requires accepting the authority of the Church who pronounced them.

Historically again, the final canon of the Bible was not established shortly after the messengers set out, but somewhere around the 500 A.D., after those first few Ecumenical Councils whose decision the Protestants accept, but whose authority they do not accept. And yet everything which the Protestants reject as corruptions, from the anointment of bishops to the consecration of the host to the adoration of Mary to prayers for the dead, are between one to four centuries older than that date, and there is no surviving record of any Christian ever doing things any other way.

### Proof from magisterium

1. Christians hold that the Bible is infallible.
2. The Catholic Church assembled the Bible, determining what was and was not scripture.
3. For any assembled thing to be infallible, it must be assembled by something infallible.
4. Thus if the Bible is infallible, the Church who assembled it must also be infallible.
5. Thus Christians who hold that the Bible is infallible must also hold that the Catholic Church is infallible.

Fifth, there is the causal argument. A fallible cause cannot produce an infallible effect. But the Church is the efficient cause of Scripture. She wrote it. She is also its formal cause: She defined its canon. Thus, if the Church is only fallible, Scripture is only fallible. So again your sola scriptura doctrine demeans the authority of the very Scripture you want to exalt.

### Proof from scriptural authority

1. 

Also, the redacted sections of the written message provide a logically insurmountable paradox for the Protestant messengers. If their sole authority for the authenticity of their message is the written part of the message, then they have no authority to redact or remove parts of the message on any grounds. They cannot throw away the Book of the Maccabeus or Tobit or the Letters of James or anything else because they claim that neither they nor anyone has the authority to define the cannon.

### Proof from unity

1. Christ founded a single unified Church.
2. Christ commanded obedience from his followers.
3. To rebel against the Church Christ founded is to disobey Christ.
4. Any group which split off from the unified Church which Christ founded is disobedient.
5. All denominations now existing either split off from the Catholic Church, or are unified to the Catholic Church.
6. Thus the Catholic Church is the unified Church which Christ founded, and which his followers should obey.

### Proof from communion

1. Christ commanded his followers to eat his body and drink his blood.
2. The apostles and immediate followers of the early church understood this to be a literal command, which they followed in the Eucharist.
3. Groups denying the presence of Christ in the Eucharist were always branded heretics and subject to Church discipline.
4. Because it has always been heretical, it is still heretical to deny Christ's presence in the Eucharist.
5. Christians wishing to obey Christ's command, should enter into a Church which has the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
6. Only the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church have the Eucharist.
7. Christians should enter the Catholic Church. (or Orthodox if you really have to)

### Proof from continuity

1. Christ instituted eternal truths for his followers.
2. These eternal truths cannot reverse, by the meaning of "eternal."
3. There are churches whose truths have reversed, and Churches whose truths have not reversed.
4. Churches whose truths have reversed, have violated the eternal and unchanging nature of the Truth Christ revealed.
5. The Catholic Church has not changed her dogmas, only (in a rather limited fashion) has she changed her prudential practices.

### Proof from chastity

1. Christ forbade divorce. (Mark 10:9)
2. Many churches calling themselved Christian believe divorce is acceptable.
3. The Catholic Church does not allow divorce.

### Proof from historicity

1. It is possible that the Catholic Church was at one point a valid, Christian authority that all should submit to, but then became corrupted and lost that authority such that a break with the Church was necessary.
2. There must be some point in time when this authority was lost.
3. The point in time is not assignable in a rational way.
4. Thus the Catholic Church never lost the authority she had from the beginning.

### Proof from ignorance of history

1. The Catholic Church is richly historical.
2. Knowledge of, and veneration for history is important in order for the Church Christ founded to grow.
3. Denominations other than the Catholic Church are naturally ahistorical.
4. Thus denominations other than the Catholic Church cannot grow properly, and are corrupted or stunted.
5. The Catholic Church does not have this flaw, and can truly grow and develop as Christ intended.

1. A lack of history implies a lack of tradition.
2. Tradition and connection to the past is necessary for the Church to remain true the the revelation she has received.

### Proof from heresy

1. Heresies are always simplifications of a complex and interdependent organism of ideas into a single master idea.
2. Upon examination, all non-Catholic denominations fit the simplification pattern of heresy.
  1. lacking some (or all) of the seven sacraments
  2. historical ignorance
  3. missing hierarchical governance
3. By default, the only non-heretical church remaining is the Catholic Church.

### Proof from balanced judgement

### Proof from false accusations

### Proof from sacramental life

#### Proof that Protestants are the false Church

The Lutherans were not being completely arbitrary, but neither was the argument being made in good faith, since one of the points of dispute between Luther and the Catholic Church was the legitimacy of prayers for the dead, which logically implies a purgatory or other intermediate condition aside from heaven or hell. The Book of Maccabeus contains references to Jews praying for the dead. The theologian who argues that scripture is the sole and sufficient source of all learning needed for salvation conveniently leaves out the scriptures that disagree with his pet theories.


#### Discussion on first proof

Objection:

> Questions on 3: why do christians _need_ to regard each other as anything? Could one not go off in solitude or in a small group to lead their christian lives?
> Question on the whole thing: Does this assume the immutability of the Catholic church? Could not it have deviated from Jesus's founding doctrine and thus the Protestants returned to that in their split? (I don't think that's what happened, but it could be worth a clarification).
> That is, *IF* the Catholic church had gone astray, would it be an option to split? Or is internal reform the only path?

Reply:

> it is true that the orthodox church esp in russia, but even some church fathers like Jerome, would go off in solitude as hermits to worship God
> but I think this kind of activity is best understood as a temporary "trial in the wilderness" like what Jesus went through when he was tempted, or what the prophet Elijah did after he killed all the priests of Baal
> given my definition of a "Church" in #2, the idea of an entirely "loose and separate" Christianity that is not practiced communally... just doesn't make much sense.
> this does assume the immutability of the Catholic Church
> but I also think that even if you assume that the Church had become wholly corrupted
> you would not have a good case for splitting it
> because in order to split and found your own church, you need the authority to do that
> and that authority can only 1. come personally from God, which no protestants claim (except the Mormons) OR 2. be passed down through the existing church hierarchy which has the delegated authority of Christ.
> But if that delegated authority were dissapated through corruption, it would just be lost
> you still would not have the right to form your own Church
> I do not believe in the right of rebellion on any level but the personal level
> ie, you are allowed to rebel personally from specific commands from an immediate superior that contradict more important commands from a higher superior
> but you must accept the personal consequenses fo such
> and continue to acknowldge the lower authority as a rightful authority even when they order you to do something wrong.
