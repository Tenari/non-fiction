All Protestants should join the Catholic Church

1. Christians are members of the Church, which was established by Jesus and his disciples.
2. The Church is the company of all Christians regarded as a spiritual body.
3. No spiritual body can function properly when its various members regard each other as false, or not a part of the body.
4. Thus if the Church is to function properly, its members must regard each other as a part of the same body.
5. Protestants and Catholics generally do not regard each other as part of the same body. 
7. Thus if the Church is to function properly, Protestants and Catholics must merge to become one body.
8. If a group splits, where one side of the split does not want the split to occur, and the other does, then one side is the original, and the other is the rebel.
9. Protestants desired to establish their own, distinct body, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Protestants are the rebels.
10. Catholics desired to keep Protestants together, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Catholics are the original.
11. When two groups merge, if one is the original, and one is the rebel, the rebel must submit to the original. This is called Repentance.
12. Thus, if Protestants and Catholics must merge, Protestants must submit to Catholics, in repentance.
13. By #7 and #12, if the Church is to function properly, Protestants must submit to Catholics in repentance.
14. All Protestants should desire the Church to function properly.
15. Thus all Protestants should join the Catholic Church.
