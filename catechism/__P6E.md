# IN BRIEF

1870. "God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all" (â‡’ Rom 11:32).

1871. Sin is an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law (St. Augustine, Faust 22: PL 42, 418). It is an offense against God. It rises up against God in a disobedience contrary to the obedience of Christ.

1872. Sin is an act contrary to reason. It wounds man's nature and injures human solidarity.

1873. The root of all sins lies in man's heart. the kinds and the gravity of sins are determined principally by their objects.

1874. To choose deliberately - that is, both knowing it and willing it - something gravely contrary to the divine law and to the ultimate end of man is to commit a mortal sin. This destroys in us the charity without which eternal beatitude is impossible. Unrepented, it brings eternal death.

1875. Venial sin constitutes a moral disorder that is reparable by charity, which it allows to subsist in us.

1876. The repetition of sins - even venial ones - engenders vices, among which are the capital sins.
