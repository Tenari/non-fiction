2552. The tenth commandment forbids avarice arising from a passion for riches and their attendant power.

2553. Envy is sadness at the sight of another's goods and the immoderate desire to have them for oneself. It is a capital sin.

2554. The baptized person combats envy through good-will, humility, and abandonment to the providence of God.

2555. Christ's faithful "have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires" (⇒ Gal 5:24); they are led by the Spirit and follow his desires.

2556. Detachment from riches is necessary for entering the Kingdom of heaven. "Blessed are the poor in spirit."

2557. "I want to see God" expresses the true desire of man. Thirst for God is quenched by the water of eternal life (cf In 4:14).
