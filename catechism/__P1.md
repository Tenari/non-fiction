# PROLOGUE

"FATHER,... this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."

"God our Saviour desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth."

"There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" - than the name of JESUS.
