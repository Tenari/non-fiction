# IN BRIEF

2504. "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor" (⇒ Ex 20:16). Christ's disciples have "put on the new man, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness" (⇒ Eph 4:24).

2505. Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in words, and guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy.

2506. The Christian is not to "be ashamed of testifying to our Lord" (⇒ 2 Tim 1:8) in deed and word. Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith.

2507. Respect for the reputation and honor of persons forbids all detraction and calumny in word or attitude.

2508. Lying consists in saying what is false with the intention of deceiving the neighbor who has the right to the truth.

2509. An offense committed against the truth requires reparation.

2510. The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether or not it would be appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it.

2511. "The sacramental seal is inviolable" (⇒ CIC, can. 983 # 1). Professional secrets must be kept. Confidences prejudicial to another are not to be divulged.

2512. Society has a right to information based on truth, freedom, and justice. One should practice moderation and discipline in the use of the social communications media.

2513. The fine arts, but above all sacred art, "of their nature are directed toward expressing in some way the infinite beauty of God in works made by human hands. Their dedication to the increase of God's praise and of his glory is more complete, the more exclusively they are devoted to turning men's minds devoutly toward God" (SC 122).
