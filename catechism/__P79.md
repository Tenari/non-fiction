# IN BRIEF

2075. "What good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" - "If you would enter into life, keep the

commandments" (⇒ Mt 19:16-17).

2076. By his life and by his preaching Jesus attested to the permanent validity of the Decalogue. 2077 The

gift of the Decalogue is bestowed from within the covenant concluded by God with his people. God's

commandments take on their true meaning in and through this covenant.

2078. In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with Jesus' example, the tradition of the Church has always

acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the Decalogue.

2079. The Decalogue forms an organic unity in which each "word" or "commandment" refers to all the others

taken together. To transgress one commandment is to infringe the whole Law (cf ⇒ Jas 2:10-11).

2080. The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural law. It is made known to us by divine

revelation and by human reason.

2081. The Ten Commandments, in their fundamental content, state grave obligations. However, obedience

to these precepts also implies obligations in matter which is, in itself, light.

2082. What God commands he makes possible by his grace.
