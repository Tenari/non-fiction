# The proof from composition:

[Adapted from Edward Feser](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Proofs-Existence-Edward-Feser-ebook/dp/B0754MJFMG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503949386&sr=8-1&keywords=5+proofs+of+the+existence+of+god)

1. The fact that the things of our everyday experience are composite, eventually leads to the conclusion that God exists.
    - (A thing is composite if it is composed of more than one distinct part.)
2. A composite thing exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment.
3. This composition of parts requires a concurrent cause. (It requires some outside thing or things to cause the parts to be combined.)
4. So, any composite thing has a cause of its existence at any moment during which it exists.
5. So, each of the things of our experience has a cause at any moment during which it exists. (Everything we see is being caused as we see it)
6. If the cause of a composite thing's existence at any moment is itself composite, then it will in turn require a cause of its own existence at that moment.
7. The regress of causes this entails is hierarchical in nature (a per se causal chain), and such a regress must therefore have a first member.
8. Only something absolutely simple or non-composite could in principle be the first member of such a series.
9. So, the existence of each of the things of our experience presupposes an absolutely simple or non-composite cause.
10. God is this absolutely simple or non-composite cause of all composite things.
