### Abortion

Error: Abortion is sometimes allowable.

Truth: Abortion is murder, which is evil.

### Atheism

Error: There is no way to prove that God exists.

Truth: There is more than one way to prove that God exists. It has been shown logically by Aquinas, in five ways. It has been shown practically by virtue.

### Blank Slate

Error: Any man, with the right training, could become the next Bethoveen.

Truth: Not all men have the same potential. Every man is unique, and thus is suited to different tasks in different ways. No amount of training can alter fundamental human nature.

### Consequentialism

Error: It is sometimes justified to choose evil means in order to achieve good ends.

Truth: Evil means should never be chosen, because only God can foresee all the consequences of any given action, thus no human can rightly calculate if any good end will result from evil means. Also, don't be evil. Choosing evil, whatever the justification, is still choosing evil. Don't choose evil.

### Contraception

Error: Contraception is morally neutral, and should be promoted for safe sex.

Truth: Contraception is gravely evil, because it perverts the most unifying act a man and woman can enjoy. Promotion of contraception is evil, because promoting evil is itself evil, and because the reliable effect of promoting contraception is to destroy society's intuitions about sexual morality.

### Democracy

Error: Democracy is the "worst form of government, except for all the others."

Truth: Democracy is a fundamentally anti-heirachical and liberal. Hierarchy being natural and necessary to human flourishing, democracy thus hinders human nature and prevents human flourishing. Liberalism being, incoherent, democracy is also incoherent and thus ineffective and unstable.

### Divorce

Error: Divorce is sometimes necessary.

Truth: Divorce is evil. Evil is never justified. Therefore, divorce is never necessary.

### Education

Error: Public education is necessary for a flourishing society.

Truth: Public education is harmful to society. An educated public is of some utility to society, but public education by its nature cannot achieve this.

### Equality

Error: All men are created equal.

Truth: All men are created unique, that is, unlike any other, that is unequal to any other. In what sense could the equality of men be true? None that I know.

### Evil

Error: Evil is exists and poses a problem to the existence of God.

Truth: Evil is a privation of good, and does not exist in its own right. All that was created is Good, just as God Himself is Good. Thus evil poses no challenge to the existence of God.

### Formal Religion

Error: Formal religion is bad, and it is better instead to listen to your heart.

Truth: Formal religion is necessary for Christian Unity. The heart is easily lead astray, while the Holy Bride of Christ which is the Church, is not so easily mislead.

### Freedom

Error: More freedom is better.

Truth: Since freedom is the capacity to choose what we desire, freedom is only ever as good as our own desires. On earth we are wicked and our desires are evil, so freedom is often bad for us. In heaven we shall be truly free, as we shall desire only what is good, which we will be able to do.

### Gluttony

Error: Gluttony is not a real sin, or is not a big deal if it is one.

Truth: Gluttony is one of the deadly sins, and is rampant in modern America.

### Hedonism

Error: The purpose of life is to get as much physical pleasure as possible.

Truth: The purpose of life is the love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind.

### Homosexuality

Error: Homosexuality is morally neutral, and gay "marriage" is a good thing.

Truth: Marriage is fundamentally between only a man and a woman, and only in that context is sex ever licit, thus homosexuality cannot ever be morally licit.

### Liberalism

Error: Securing maximum freedom and equal rights is the primary purpose of government.

Truth: The primary purpose of government is to restrain evil and to promote good. [Freedom](#freedom) is not always good, and [equality](#equality) is nonsense outside of mathematical contexts.

### Minimum Wage

Error: Raising the minimum wage helps people.

Truth: The amount of wealth created by people cannot be increased by fiat (law). People themeselves are the engine of wealth creation, and if a minimum wage does help certain people, it does so only at the expense of others (like those seeking employment, or those running businesses).

### Pacifism

Error: It is never right to do violence.

Truth: Just War doctrine is correct. Self defense is moral. Defense of the innocent is moral. All these make violence sometimes right.

### Voting

Error: Voting is good, and you should choose the lesser of two evils.

Truth: Never choose evil. Never formally cooperate with evil. Voting is at best a waste of time, and at worst formal cooperation with evil.
