# A Powergamer's Guide to Winning at Life on Earth

by Daniel Zapata

---

Earth is an MMO where you have to play as human, you don't get to pick your race, or your gender, and there are no re-rolls or resurrection (unless you unlock the Jesus feat).

Like any MMO, people play for many different reasons. Some want to "enjoy the world" or "hang out with friends" or some such bullshit. Others, powergamers, play to WIN.

This is how I suggest you go about doing that.

Since you don't get to pick your stats (strength, intelligence, charisma) in this game, your character class is kind of chosen for you. A true powergamer always plays to his strengths.

If you're at all smart (measured by how quickly you can learn math), especially if you speak english, then you definitely need to play as a wizard. This game is super unbalanced IMO, and wizards have a ton of advantages. That's not to say that you can't win by playing another class, but honestly, you're gonna need way more luck to win in other ways. Wizards are so unbalanced, that even if you are more athletic than 90% of humans, and only smarter than 55% of humans, you definitely need to play as a wizard.

If you hit the genetic lottery and you've got the physical chops to be the best at a select few sports, then you can play as a warrior and still win. Otherwise, you're wasting your time, pick another class.

If you aren't good at math, but people like you, congrats, you're playing as a rogue/thief, or in modern parlance: politician/lawyer/salesman.

If you're totally average, or below average, the best you can probably do is play as a bard and hope to get lucky.

Once you've picked your class, the game is pretty straightforward. Just grind at your stat until you hit the endgame. Then you can do whatever the fuck you want. Every powergamer knows that the real game doesn't start until level 99, so the important thing is to grind as efficiently as you can to get to the endgame where the real fun is.

The reason most people suck at this game is that they don't know what endgame they are aiming for. They don't have realistic expectations about what endgames are possible, or they lose sight of the engame, or they get tired of the grind and stop playing. Look, it's your character, do whatever you want with it, but I'm just saying, follow my guide and you'll win. Do something else, and dont be surprised when you lose.

# Wizards

Your stat is money.

Famous wizards are:
- Benjamin Graham
- Warren Buffet
- Peter Lynch
- Henry Ford
- Thomas Edison
- The original Rothschild guy
- Peter Thiel
- Jeff Bezos
- Sergey Brin + Larry Page
- Cuckerberg

The thing you'll notice about this list is that these guys are all an order of magnitude (or two) richer than the guys from the other categories. There's a reason I said that being a wizard is where it's at, yo.

The essential characteristic of a wizard is that they use secret knowledge to their advantage. Some of these guys discovered secret knowledge for themselves and used it. Others on here just took knowledge that was already out there and applied it to a field no one else had. But all of these guys were doing things that basically no one else understood. And because other players couldn't or wouldn't take the time to understand the things these guys knew, these guys have an inexplicable quality to them. Plus some good dice rolls never hurt anyone.

## Subclasses

There are two main subclasses that people play this as: Investor and Inventor.

## The grind cycle

## Sample playthrough

each number is your age:

3. learn to read
4. read everything you can get your hands on
5. learn more things from books


# Warriors

Your stat is fame.

Famous warriors are:
- Arnold Schwarzenegger
- Micheal Jordan
- Floyd Mayweather
- Tiger woods
- Arnold Palmer
- Lebron James
- Roger Federer
- Cristiano Ronaldo
- etc...

You might be tempted to think that your stat is sprinting time or lifting weight. It's not. Your stat is fame.

The essential characteristic of a successful warrior is leveraging extraordinary physical prowess into fame. Because of this game mechanic called "ageing," warriors are at a disadvantage to other classes in that they only have a very short time window in which to win or lose. Because as soon as they are off their peak physical performance, their ability to garner fame falls off exponentially until they're just some random fucker working at Dick's sporting goods.

# Rogues

Your stat is friends.

Famous rogues are:
- Franklin D Roosevelt
- Bill Clinton
- Vladimir Putin
- Al Gore
- Howard K Stern
- Richard Scruggs
- Judge Judy
- Steve Jobs
- Mary Kay Ash
- the guy from wolf of wall street

I almost wrote "Your stat is power," but since humans are social animals, it's kind of implied that friends = power. Especially in this shitty patch where the devs made every fucking country a democracy.

The essential characteristic of a rogue is persuasion.

# Bard

Don't be a bard. Your stat is fame.

Famous Bards:
- Leonardo Da'Vinci
- Fucking beiber
- Brad Pitt
- etc...

Look. You *can* win as a bard. But **you** wont. It's true that the bulk of winning bards put in a lot of time and effort, but it's also true that for every Jimmy Hendrix who makes a ton of money, there is a [Micheal Angelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Angelo_Batio) who no one has ever heard of.

The essential characteristic of a bard is attention whoring.
