# Definition of liberalism

November 18, 2013

**Liberalism** is the idea that giving people freedom and equal rights is a primary purpose of government.

A *liberal* is a person who believes in this idea.

The liberal may believe this because of practical reasons, or because he believes that the just powers of government come from the consent of the governed.  But whatever the reason he believes it, a person who believes in liberalism is a liberal.

A liberal doesn't have to believe that giving people freedom and equal rights is the only purpose of government: he just has to see it as a primary purpose.

The idea that liberals don't genuinely believe in freedom and equal rights is false. They do. But the idea that they don't leaves the door open for other kinds of liberals to claim that their version of liberalism (which they may or may not label "liberalism") is the real version. Thus the split of modern politics into different versions of liberalism: in the United States the two main versions are the right liberals (the Republican party) and the left liberals (the Democratic party). Despite the apparent division, all respectable political opinion (and much unrespectable opinion) is liberal opinion.

But who are the authentic liberals? In fact there are no authentic liberals, because liberalism is incoherent. An authentic version of liberalism does not exist: it is impossible by definition. Government is a discriminating authority which uses force to support a particular vision of what is good. That's what government is. An idea of government that makes the primary purpose of government to be preventing authoritative discrimination is self-contradictory.

A right is a specific discriminating authority possessed by an individual; for example a property right discriminates between the owner and the trespasser, treating the former's claims as authoritative over the latter's claims.  The doctrine of equal rights requires that rights be distributed without discrimination: it requires that in the distribution of discriminating authorities (rights) there shall be no discrimination and no authority (equality).

Intuitively one might think that this internal incoherence would make liberalism non-viable as a political doctrine, but in fact the opposite is the case.  When the doctrine one embraces is self-contradictory in a way that is (perhaps) not obvious, it is possible to derive all sorts of conclusions – even conclusions which are in conflict with each other – from that doctrine.  In practice this makes the doctrine very 'flexible', and creates a subtle (or not so subtle) shift of frame.  The frameshift makes considerations of what is true turn blurry, and makes what individuals will come sharply into focus as paramount.

So when liberals tell you that they are "pro choice" in an undistilled abstract sense independent of the actual content of those choices, they are telling the truth.  The reason that each faction of liberalism in practice treats some choices as legitimate and some as illegitimate – with different understandings depending on the faction, setting up the intramural conflicts between different sorts of liberals which dominate modern politics – arises from the fact that in order to govern at all it is necessary to discriminate authoritatively.   Thus the implicit corollary doctrine of the superman which inevitably appears in every form of liberalism as its self-contradictory substrate encounters particular realities.
