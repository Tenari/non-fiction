useless conversations online, with an evidence-denying, dogmatic christian cultist; or angry, trope-repeating atheist, where neither side will give any ground. Makes us ask what is the point of this conversation? To win some zingers? or to help the other person?
What would it take to convince you? I think most cannot answer this.
