Ideal non-school way to grow up learning things (in order):

First, the focus of teaching is entirely on a few key foundational skills, which pre-require each other. Accomplish one well before moving to next:
learn to talk 2 languages (parents should be at least bilingual, so kids can grow up bilingual):
  colors, numbers, animals, body parts, etc... basic vocabulary expansion for children.
learn to read english
  any basic learn-to-read course will work.
once @ kinda-okay reading level, learn to read 2nd language
  keep expanding/pushing reading level requirements for kid by requiring 30mins a day assigned reading in each language. (need to have ordered list of books from easy to hard)
basic numeracy:
  -count to 100
  -super simple adding
  -super simple subtracting

At this point it changes from whole focus on one skill, to just spending a chunk (30m - 1h) each day improving on each topic:
literacy
  - continually harder books, one in each language.
numeracy
  - learn math all the way up to calculus. step by step, lots of practice and repetition
physical
  - exposure to sports, learn to play one well
musical
  - learn an instrument

Once child is able to read mostly any novel they want, and able to do algebra add:
computing
  - programming courses like codecademy
third language
  - mnemosyne flash cards + duolingo
history
  - work your way chronologically through the major civilizations Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, Europe, Britian, America. Flashcards work well here
science
  - broad overview of the various major studies of science: Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Ecology, Astronomy, Zoology, Botany, etc: and let the student pick one to work on. Flash cards are cool.

Iterate adding new things as child is competent:
musical
  - new instruments, writing music
science
  - different branches
history
  -deep dive on interesing civilizations/people (napoleon) after covering borad review of all history
languages
  - add a new one every other year ish
computing
  - new tools/programmign languages

Require periodic projects in:
computing
musical (performances)
history (esssay)

around high-school age, let them tell you what they want to focus on, and let them focus on it.
