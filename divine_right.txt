Divine Right and Diabolic Wrong

"there is a Divine Right or else a Diabolic Wrong at the heart of every claim that one man makes upon another" -- Thomas Carlyle

Authority is real, as much as the rebellious teenager would try to deny it. Indeed, our whole modern society has the temperment of a teen yelling to his father "You can't tell me what to do!" And, just as with the teenager, we are wrong to yell it, for his father really *can* tell him what to do. That classic father's rejoinder "I brought you into this world; I can bring you out" hints at the foundation of parental authority, the fact of _source_. From whence comes the teen? From the father, of course! To whom shall the teen be subject? The father, of course! To anyone not insane, this structure of authority and obedience between father and child is intuitive. Obvious. Yet, when it comes to the affairs of our wider society, we rebellious teenagers in the bodies of men declare with much ferocity, "You have no right to rule over me!" Are we right? Only if we have no source. If we spring eternal from ourselves, then we have full authority over ourselves, and truly, no one other may rightly tell us what to do. But, since only God springs eternal from himself, we are not the rulers of ourselves. We come from somewhere, or someone rather, and to somewhere or someone we owe our allegiance and obedience.
