> There are billions of galaxies, why would God care about the sex life of naked primates living on an insignificant rock on the edge of one tiny galaxy?

Being omniscient, nothing is too small for God to care about: "Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns — and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?" -- http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm

> I do not accept information based on the authority of the source of the information.

All humans must accept information based on the authority of the source of the information. Did you discover that that the earth is round on your own? Did you do the experiment to prove that the gravitaional constant is 6.674×10−11 m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2?

> You don't believe in thousands of gods like Thor or Zeus. I just don't believe in one god more.
> What makes you think your god is real, but not all the other gods?

Classical theism does not seek to show the existence of yet another "god," but rather, the existence of God, which is an entirely distinct concept. While other gods are entities which exist within the universe, God is the principle of subsitence existence itself. God is NOT some powerful being running around outer space. God is rather Being Itself. The proof that God exists comes through philosophical argumentation.

> There is no verifiable evidence which would be acceptable within the scientific method that proves that God exists.

Agreed. Science is the wrong tool for the job of discovering God. Science measures physical reality. God is immaterial; not physical. He does not interact with the world in a regular, law-like manner which can be measured by science. He is the principle by which physical reality exists at all. Thus, demanding scientific evidence is silly, like demanding that I use a metal detector to find evidence of wood.

> Metaphysical thoughts and philosophical arguments are not valid proof that God exists.

They are valid proof of mathematical theorems. They are how we reason about everything in life. Even scientific arguments are just a special case of philosophical argumentation. A valid argument is valid proof that God exists.

> There is no proof that God exists.

> I don't believe in objective evil.

I don't believe that you believe that. Quote something they said back at themselves. No one can consistently hold this view.
