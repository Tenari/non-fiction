# Overview

What follows is the ideal non-school way to grow up learning things (in order).

First, the focus of teaching is entirely on a few key foundational skills, which pre-require each other. Accomplish one well before moving to next:

- learn to talk 2 languages (parents should be at least bilingual, so kids can grow up bilingual):
  - colors, numbers, animals, body parts, etc... basic vocabulary expansion for children.
- learn to read english, any basic learn-to-read course will work.
- once @ kinda-okay reading level, learn to read 2nd language
  - keep expanding/pushing reading level requirements for kid by requiring 30mins a day assigned reading in each language. (need to have ordered list of books from easy to hard)
- basic numeracy:
  - count to 100
  - super simple adding
  - super simple subtracting

At this point it changes from whole focus on one skill, to just spending a chunk (30m - 1h) each day improving on each topic:

- literacy
  - continually harder books, one in each language.
- numeracy
  - learn math all the way up to calculus. step by step, lots of practice and repetition
- physical
  - exposure to sports, learn to play one well
- musical
  - learn an instrument

Once child is able to read mostly any novel they want, and able to do algebra add:

- computing
  - programming courses like codecademy
- third language
  - mnemosyne flash cards + duolingo
- history
  - work your way chronologically through the major civilizations Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, Europe, Britian, America. Flashcards work well here
- science
  - broad overview of the various major studies of science: Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Ecology, Astronomy, Zoology, Botany, etc: and let the student pick one to work on. Flash cards are cool.
- theology and philosophy
  - four pronged readinglist

Iterate adding new things as child is competent:

- musical
  - new instruments, writing music
- science
  - different branches
- history
  - deep dive on interesing civilizations/people (napoleon) after covering borad review of all history
- languages
  - add a new one every other year ish
- computing
  - new tools/programmign languages

Require periodic projects in:

- computing
- musical (performances)
- history (esssay)
- theology (essay)

around high-school age, let them tell you what they want to focus on, and let them focus on it.

# Detailed Baby years

For my purposes here, "the baby years" constitute the time from birth until the child is able to read short kids books. Hank the Cowdog is on the harder end of the target here.

The most important skill a baby learns is speech. At this time in a child's life it is remarkably easy to pick up a language, so advantage must be taken to raise the children bilingual. This of course requires bilingual parents. But, having had the experience of bilingual parents who failed to instill in me a "natural" second language, I can assure you that it is necessary to be proactive about the use of both languages. Some suggestions for ways to structure the use of both languages as you teach your child to speak:

- Designate different contexts different languages. For example:
  - whenever you're outdoors, use language A, whenever you are indoors, use language B. 
  - eating meals is language A
  - playing is language B
  - with friends = A, with own family = B
- Designate different times for different languages
  - weekends are A, weekdays are B
  - alternate A week vs B week
  - mornings are A, evenings are B

There are many ways to divide this up. Some are probably more natural than others. Feel free to experiment with what works, but it is important to make the language rules clear between you, your spouse, and your child. Without rules, people will be tempted to lapse into the language they are more familiar with (probably english) and then the other language atrophies from disuse.

After the baby is able to speak without too much "baby talk" it is possible to begin teaching reading. Many parents have realized that the best way to get your child interested in reading is to read them bed-time stories. Let them pick the books. Let them look at the pages as you read. Let them turn the pages. The point here is to motivate them to want to learn to read for themselves.

There are a wide range of methods for teaching children to read. Look them up. One technique I recall from my youth was a small sandbox. I would be required to trace the
