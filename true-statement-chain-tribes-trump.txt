People love to bash on Trump
Their critiscisms are often illogical
People are tribal by nature
Thus,
The people who like to bash on Trump percieve him as out of their tribe.

If you largely encounter anti-trump feelings, you live in an anti-trump tribe
If you personally are not anti-trump, you disagree with your tribe.
No person perfectly agrees with their tribe.
But, the more prominent a feature of the tribe is, the more important that feature is to tribal membership.
Anti-Trump-ness is a very prominent feature of the american Blue tribe.
Thus,
If you are not anti-trump, but you live in an anti-trump tribe, you are not really a member of the tribe you live in.

Tribal membership is important to the social happiness of man.
