# Against Materialism

## Proofs

Proof by goodness

1. Everything that exists is physical.
2. Moral Goodness is not physical.
3. Thus, Moral Goodness is not objective; is not real.
    - Subjective Goodness is incoherent. _[proof](#subjective-goodness-is-incoherent)_
4. Everyone acts in accord with what he thinks is good in some sense.
5. By combination of #3 and #4, everyone acts irrationally, always.
6. #5 is absurd, and known to be false. Thus, the premise is false.

Proof by mind _[source](http://www.scifiwright.com/2012/02/the-argument-against-materialism/)_

1. If something cannot be described in material terms, and we percieve it, then it is immaterial.
2. The mind cannot be described in material terms.
3. We each percieve our own mind.
4. Thus the mind is immaterial.

## Definitions

Materialism: the belief that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all phenomena, including mental phenomena and consciousness, are identical with material interactions.

## Supporting Proofs

### Subjective Goodness is incoherent

The principle of subjective goodness assumes that at least one objective good exists: The pursuit of our subjective conceptions of good. But if it is objectively good to pursue our subjective conceptions of good, then objective moral goodness exists.
