A Proposal for a Fraternal House

Purpose:
To foster a place of retreat from the pervading ugliness, and diversity of modern life.

Method:
Have a building open 24/7 which men can go be men at. Pay a monthly membership. Have whiskey, beer, and cigars available. Have a large central quiet room with comfy armchairs and fireplace. Have private rooms at the sides. Decor is important--wooden, carvings, art, beauty. None of the hard edges of modernity.

Foundational Rules:

1. No women.
2. No children.
3. No gays.
4. New members must be recommended by two current members.

Details:
Have one guy own the building and lease it to a corporation, which he also own. Have the corporation continually lose money by changing the lease to be more and more, so that the company has negative assets in the case ofinevitable lawsuit. Dont write down any exclusionary rules. Make the club operate on the "owner decides" principle in name. Name the owning company with some nonsense hash "aef57ec48" to make it more difficult for people to understand what the club does, and to make it more easy to restart should the company be sued and need to "close" up shop.
