I am contingent, because I do not contain within myself the entirety of the reason for my own existence.
  We know this this true, because my existence was dependent on my parents, is dependent on my continued intake of breath, and will eventually cease (at least physically).
To explain the existence of a contingent thing, untimately, requires recourse to a non-contingent thing.
  We know this is true because any explanation composed entirely of other contingent things would either:
    go to infinity, which is an absurdity in the case of a hierarcical causal series, or
    terminate with a contingent thing, which would leave the initial thing at least partially unexplained.
Thus, to explain my own existence, I must posit the existence of some non-contingent explanation.
