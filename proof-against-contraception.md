# Purpose: to show that using contraception is immoral.

#### Proof from existence of God

1. God is the source of all existence.
2. God is good.
3. Good does not create evil.
4. Thus everything that exists is good.
5. If evil objectively existed, then God would have created it, because of #1.
6. Thus, evil does not objectively exist in its own right.
7. Thus, what we consider "evil" is best understood as a privation of good, or a *lack* of goodness.
8. If evil is a privation of good, then _contraception is evil_ by the [proof from privation view of evil](#proof-from-privation-view-of-evil).

#### Proof from privation view of evil

1. Evil is a privation of good.
2. By definition, it is evil to actively prevent that which is good.
3. The creation of good is good.
4. Human life is good.
5. If #3 and #4 are true, then the creation of human life is good.
6. Contraception actively prevents the creation of human life.
7. By substitution, contraception actively prevents that which is good.
8. Thus, _contraception is evil._

#### Proof from natural law

1. [Natural Law](#definitions) [is real.](#proof-that-natural-law-is-real)
2. Breaking the natural law is always immoral.
3. [Using contraception breaks the natural law.](#proof-that-using-contraception-breaks-the-natural-law)
4. Therefore using _contraception is immoral._

#### Proof from consequences to self

1. Deliberate self-harm is immoral.
2. Using contraception [causes harm](#proof-that-contraception-causes-self-harm) to the people using it.
3. Therefore using _contraception is immoral._

#### Proof from extra-marital sex

_Adapted from [John C Wright](http://www.scifiwright.com/2012/01/contra-contraception-2/)._

1. Extra-marital sex is bad.
2. Promoting something bad is bad.
3. Using contraception promotes contraception to the society at large.
4. Promoting contraception leads to widespread acceptance of contraception.
5. Widespread acceptance of contraception promotes extra-marital sex by making it easier to "get away with."
6. By substitution of 4, promoting contraception promotes extra-marital sex.
7. By substitution of 3, Using contraception promotes extra-marital sex.
8. By #2, _using contraception is bad._

See [discussion](#discussion-on-proof-from-extra-marital-sex) 

Alternate form

1. Whatever inhibits goodness or flourishing is evil.
2. Stable marriages are necessary to a flourishing society.
3. [Extra-marital sex destabilizes existing marriages](http://socialpathology.blogspot.com/2012/03/promiscuity-data-guest-post.html), and makes people less likely to form new marriages.
4. Contraception facilitates, and thus increases or causes extra-marital sex.
5. By substitution, contraception destabilizes existing marriages, and makes people less likely to form new marriages.
6. But destabilizing what is necessary for flourishing is equivalent to inhibiting flourishing.
7. Thus contraception inhibits flourishing.
8. Thus by #1, _contraception is evil._

#### Proof from human psychology

1. Truth does not change.
2. Some beliefs are mutually exclusive.
    1. eg: "contraception is always morally licit" and  "contracteption is always immoral"
3. When a group of humans changes their position to something mutually exclusive with their previous position, they are either wrong now, or were wrong in the past.
4. Humans tend to rationalize their desires for evil things as being good.
5. If contraception is widely available, humans tend to desire "easier, consequence-free" sex via contraception.
6. If contraception is immoral and widely available, then by #4 and #5, many humans will not consider it to be immoral.
7. If contraception is immoral and not widely available, then the distorting influence of #4 is not present, and truth is easier to discover.
8. Prior to the 1930's, [all significant christian denominations held contraception to be immoral](http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-04-020-f).
9. Prior to the 1930's, contraception was not widely available.
10. After the 1930's, contraception was widely available.
11. After the 1930's, contraception was widely socially accepted by almost all Christian denominations.
12. By #3, pro-contraception denominations are either wrong now, or were wrong for the bulk of their historical existence.
13. By #7, it was easier to discover the truth about contraception for most of history.
14. By #6 and #10, if contraception is immoral, then many humans will not consider it to be immoral.
15. If contraception is moral, then there is no reason for church doctrinal change on the issue to be correlated with the availability of contraception.
16. Church doctrinal change on the issue is correlated with the availability of contraception.
17. Therefore, unless the correlation is random or spurious, it is more likely that _contraception is immoral_, than that it is moral.

#### Proof from purpose of government

1. The purpose of government is to restrain the evil desires of its citizens via the promise of punishment.
2. The current laws and culture defining the Sexual Marketplace (SMP) allow the evil desires of the participants free reign.
3. Making contraception illegal to produce or sell would severely restrict the free reign of the evil sexual desires of the participants in the SMP.
4. Thus making contracpetion illegal will restrain the evil desires of the citizens.
5. Thus government should make contraception illegal, if it is to fulfill its purpose.
6. But whatever the government should restrain is evil, by definition.
7. Thus _contraception is evil._

## Proof that Natural Law is real

(in progress... defining natural law rigorously is hard...)

1. Definition of [Natural Law](#definitions)
2. "Cats have four legs" is a true statement.
3. Not every single cat has four legs.
4. Thus #2 can only be true if it refers to an archetypical "cat," which contains the essential _essence_ of what it is to be a "cat."
5. Every exsitent thing has a statement similar to #2 which is true, but not true of every 

2. The relations of human beings have a natural form.
3. Aberrations from this form are rightly discouraged.
4. Repeated discouragement of an action creates, or implies the existence of a rule of conduct relating to that action.
5. Thus, the natural relations of human beings give rise to rules of conduct.
6. These rules of conduct are the definition of natural law. QED

## Proof that using contraception breaks the natural law

1. Sex has two natural purposes: Unity and procreation.
2. Natural law holds that no thing should be used in a manner directly opposed to its natural purpose.
3. Contraception is directly opposed to procreation.
4. Thus contraception breaks natural law.

## Proof that contraception causes self harm

First:

1. Women should be beautiful.
2. Contraception makes women ugly.
    1. Contraception makes women [fatter](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/uotm-sfi030409.php).
    2. Contraception makes women have [ugly voices](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/fertility-women-attractiveness-study_n_2286537.html).
    3. Contraception makes women [move in an unattractive way](http://www.livescience.com/22402-women-dances-ovulation-fertility.html).
    4. Contraception makes women infertile, which, on an instinctual level is [ugly](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200709/the-strippers-secret) to men.
    5. Contraception can make women have acne, have blotchy spots on exposed skin, gain facial hair, and have yellow skin. [source](http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/estrogen-and-progestin-oral-contraceptives-oral-route/side-effects/DRG-20069422)
3. Delibertately making oneself ugly constitutes self harm.
4. Thus contraception is harmful.

Second:

1. Divorce is harmful.
2. The divorce rate is [highly correlated](http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/divorce-pill.png), in a slightly lagging way, to the use of the oral contraceptives.
3. If there is a causative effect instead of spurious correlation, then contraception causes divorce.
4. Thus, contraception is harmful.

Third:

1. Deliberately increasing one's own risk of harm, without an outweighing benefit, constitutes self-harm.
2. Using contraceptives increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, heart attack, and blood clots.
3. Thus, unless contraceptives provide an extraordinary benefit outweighing all these risks, contraception is harmful.

Fourth:

1. Deliberately reducing one's own enjoyment, without an outweighing benefit, constitutes self-harm.
2. Using condoms reduces enjoyment of sex.
3. Thus, unless contraceptives provide an extraordinary benefit outweighing the reduction of pleasure, contraception is harmful.

Fifth:

1. Adultery, Divorce, and Fornication are sins.
2. Sins damage one's own relationship with God, which constitutes self-harm.
3. Contraception facilities all these sins, making them easier to engage in.
    1. Socially accepted use of contraception facilitates these sins by making the illusion of consequence-free sexual vice possible. 
    2. Without perceived consequences, people are more likely to sin.
4. Wide-spread acceptance of contraception is highly correlated with wide-spread de-stigmatization of these sins.
5. Thus, to the degree that using contraception makes sin more likely, contraception causes sin.
6. Thus, contraception causes self-harm.

Sixth:

1. Deliberately damaging, or limiting one's intimacy with a spouse is self-harm.
2. Using contraception reduces the likelyhood of children.
3. Producing children tends to keep parents together, which increases (or at least protects) intimacy.
4. Using contraception indicates a desire to keep a fundamental part of the woman, her fertility, out of the relationship.
5. Keeping things out of a relationship limits intimacy.
6. Using contraception implies that a woman is not fit to be a mother, which if said aloud often is an insult.
7. Insulting a spouse damages intimacy.
8. Using contraception either directly, or indirectly damages or limits intimacy with a spouse.


## Definitions

- God: The classical theistic conception of God as Pure Acutality, and Goodness Itself
- Natural Law: The idea that all things have objective essences which exist independent of the things themseleves, and the idea that these essences contain a purpose which all instantiations of the essence exist *for*, and the idea that it is good to realize the purpose of a thing, and bad to frustrate the realization of the purpose of a thing. The fundamental natural law is: the purpose of rationality is the pursuit of what is good and the avoidance of what frustrates the realization of the good.

## Discussions

#### Discussion on proof from extra-marital sex

Objection: 
```
that is very consequentialist... "owning guns leads to availability of guns leads to gun-related violence therefore guns are bad." that type of thinking just doesn't have rigor to it imo
cars promote automobile accidents != cars are bad
as far as proof is concerned 
it is still reasonable to avoid an activity that may promote an undesired result
```
Reply:
```
I guess the line you are bringing into question with your car/gun analogy is #3/#4
actually, the difference with guns is in line #5. widespread acceptance of guns does not imply widespread "gun violence" in the same way that widespread acceptance of contraception implies extra-marital sex
yeah, it's line #5 that is the crux. Because if any given technology promotes something bad, then it is bad to that degree, but if it promotes something good, then it is good to that degree, and since things can promote multiple things, then they could have a balance of good-effects and bad-effects
so essentially, for guns, they do necessarily promote some degree of "gun violence" but they also promote good things like hunting, tradition, fun, competition, self-defense, politeness, etc.
so the argument I made for contraception is true/valid reasoning, it is just not the whole picture. what the final claim should really say is "contraception is bad in this aspect"
and having shown it is bad in a (large) aspect it would now be burden of proof on some other to show that it is good in an outweighing way or ways
