# Purpose: to show that using contraception is immoral.

#### Proof from existence of God

1. God is the source of all existence.
2. God is good.
3. Good does not create evil.
4. Thus everything that exists is good.
5. If evil objectively existed, then God would have created it, because of #1.
6. Thus, evil does not objectively exist in its own right.
7. Thus, what we consider "evil" is best understood as a privation of good, or a *lack* of goodness.
8. If evil is a privation of good, then contraception is evil by the [proof from privation view of evil](#proof-from-privation-view-of-evil).

#### Proof from privation view of evil

1. Evil is a privation of good.
2. By definition, it is evil to actively prevent that which is good.
3. The creation of good is good.
4. Human life is good.
5. If #3 and #4 are true, then the creation of human life is good.
6. Contraception actively prevents the creation of human life.
7. By substitution, contraception actively prevents that which is good.
8. Thus, contraception is evil.

#### Proof from natural law

1. Natural Law is real.
2. Breaking the natural law is always immoral.
3. Using contraception breaks the natural law.
4. Therefore using contraception is immoral.

#### Proof from consequences

1. Deliberate self-harm is immoral.
2. Using contraception [causes harm](#proof-that-contraception-causes-self-harm) to the people using it.
3. Therefore using contraception is immoral.

#### Proof by [John C Wright](http://www.scifiwright.com/2012/01/contra-contraception-2/)

1. There are some things within full human power, and some things not within full human power.
3. The human mind is an admixture of [reason, passions, and appetites](#definitions).
4. Humans are happy when they achieve their [desires](#definitions) and avoid their [aversions](#definitions).
5. Any appetites and passions which align with that which the reason knows to be true and right, are feasible and praiseworthy.

## Proof that Natural Law is real

1. God exists.
2. God sustains reality.
3. Law is a rule of action put into place by one who has care of the community.
4. 

## Proof that using contraception breaks the natural law

1. Sex has two natural purposes: Unity and procreation.
2. Natural law holds that a thing must fulfill, or potentially fulfill it's purpose to be good.
3. Contraception prevents procreation.
4. This prevents sex from fully achieving it's purpose.
5. Thus contraception breaks natural law.

## Proof that contraception causes self harm

1. Women should be beautiful.
2. Contraception makes women ugly.
  1. Contraception makes women [fatter](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/uotm-sfi030409.php).
  2. Contraception makes women have [ugly voices](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/fertility-women-attractiveness-study_n_2286537.html).
  3. Contraception makes women [move in an unattractive way](http://www.livescience.com/22402-women-dances-ovulation-fertility.html).
  4. Contraception makes women infertile, which, on an instinctual level is [ugly](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200709/the-strippers-secret) to men.
  5. Contraception can make women have acne, have blotchy spots on exposed skin, gain facial hair, and have yellow skin. [source](http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/estrogen-and-progestin-oral-contraceptives-oral-route/side-effects/DRG-20069422)
3. Delibertately making oneself ugly constitutes self harm.
4. Thus contraception is harmful.

1. Divorce is harmful.
2. The divorce rate is [highly correlated](http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/divorce-pill.png), in a slightly lagging way, to the use of the oral contraceptives.
3. If there is a causative effect instead of spurious correlation, then contraception causes divorce.
4. Thus, contraception is harmful.

1. Deliberately increasing one's own risk of harm, without an outweighing benefit, constitutes self-harm.
2. Using contraceptives increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, heart attack, and blood clots.
3. Thus, unless contraceptives provide an extraordinary benefit outweighing all these risks, contraception is harmful.

1. Deliberately reducing one's own enjoyment, without an outweighing benefit, constitutes self-harm.
2. Using condoms reduces enjoyment of sex.
3. Thus, unless contraceptives provide an extraordinary benefit outweighing the reduction of pleasure, contraception is harmful.

1. Adultery, Divorce, and Fornication are sins.
2. Sins damage one's own relationship with God, which constitutes self-harm.
3. Contraception facilities all these sins, making them easier to engage in.
  1. Socially accepted use of contraception facilitates these sins by making the illusion of consequense-free sexal vice possible. 
  2. Without perceived consequences, people are more likely to sin.
4. Wide-spread acceptance of contraception is highly correlated with wide-spread de-stigmatization of these sins.
5. Thus, to the degree that using contraception makes sin more likely, contraception causes sin.
6. Thus, contraception causes self-harm.

1. Deliberately damaging, or limiting one's intimacy with a spouse is self-harm.
2. Using contraception reduces the likelyhood of children.
3. Producing children tends to keep parents together, which increases (or at least protects) intimacy.
4. Using contraception indicates a desire to keep a fundamental part of the woman, her fertility, out of the relationship.
5. Keeping things out of a relationship limits intimacy.
6. Using contraception implies that a woman is not fit to be a mother, which if said aloud often is an insult.
7. Insulting a spouse damages intimacy.
8. Using contraception either directly, or indirectly damages or limits intimacy with a spouse.
