# Purpose: to show that using contraception is immoral.

#### Proof from existence of God

1. God is the source of all existence.
2. God is good.
3. Good does not create evil.
4. Thus everything that exists is good.
5. If evil objectively existed, then God would have created it, because of #1.
6. Thus, evil does not objectively exist in its own right.
7. Thus, what we consider "evil" is best understood as a privation of good, or a *lack* of goodness.
8. If evil is a privation of good, then _contraception is evil_ by the [proof from privation view of evil](#proof-from-privation-view-of-evil).

See [discussion](#discussion-on-proof-from-existence-of-god) 

#### Proof from privation view of evil

1. Evil is a privation of good.
2. By definition, it is evil to corrupt a good.
3. Contraception corrupts the good of sex, by actively preventing the procreative function.
4. By substitution, contraception corrupts a good.
8. Thus, _contraception is evil._

#### Proof from natural law

1. [Natural Law](#definitions) [is real.](#proof-that-natural-law-is-real)
2. Breaking the natural law is always immoral.
3. [Using contraception breaks the natural law.](#proof-that-using-contraception-breaks-the-natural-law)
4. Therefore using _contraception is immoral._

#### Proof from consequences to self

1. Deliberate self-harm is immoral.
2. Using contraception [causes harm](#proof-that-contraception-causes-self-harm) to the people using it.
3. Therefore using _contraception is immoral._

See [discussion](#discussion-on-proof-from-consequences-to-self) 

#### Proof from extra-marital sex

_Adapted from [John C Wright](http://www.scifiwright.com/2012/01/contra-contraception-2/)._

1. Extra-marital sex is bad.
2. Promoting something bad is bad.
3. Using contraception promotes contraception to the society at large.
4. Promoting contraception leads to widespread acceptance of contraception.
5. Widespread acceptance of contraception promotes extra-marital sex by making it easier to "get away with."
6. By substitution of 4, promoting contraception promotes extra-marital sex.
7. By substitution of 3, Using contraception promotes extra-marital sex.
8. By #2, _using contraception is bad._

See [discussion](#discussion-on-proof-from-extra-marital-sex) 

Alternate form

1. Whatever inhibits goodness or flourishing is evil.
2. Stable marriages are necessary to a flourishing society.
3. [Extra-marital sex destabilizes existing marriages](http://socialpathology.blogspot.com/2012/03/promiscuity-data-guest-post.html), and makes people less likely to form new marriages.
4. Contraception facilitates, and thus increases or causes extra-marital sex.
5. By substitution, contraception destabilizes existing marriages, and makes people less likely to form new marriages.
6. But destabilizing what is necessary for flourishing is equivalent to inhibiting flourishing.
7. Thus contraception inhibits flourishing.
8. Thus by #1, _contraception is evil._

#### Proof from human psychology

1. Truth does not change.
2. Some beliefs are mutually exclusive.
    1. eg: "contraception is always morally licit" and  "contracteption is always immoral"
3. When a group of humans changes their position to something mutually exclusive with their previous position, they are either wrong now, or were wrong in the past.
4. Humans tend to rationalize their desires for evil things as being good.
5. If contraception is widely available, humans tend to desire "easier, consequence-free" sex via contraception.
6. If contraception is immoral and widely available, then by #4 and #5, many humans will not consider it to be immoral.
7. If contraception is immoral and not widely available, then the distorting influence of #4 is not present, and truth is easier to discover.
8. Prior to the 1930's, [all significant christian denominations held contraception to be immoral](http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-04-020-f).
9. Prior to the 1930's, contraception was not widely available.
10. After the 1930's, contraception was widely available.
11. After the 1930's, contraception was widely socially accepted by almost all Christian denominations.
12. By #3, pro-contraception denominations are either wrong now, or were wrong for the bulk of their historical existence.
13. By #7, it was easier to discover the truth about contraception for most of history.
14. By #6 and #10, if contraception is immoral, then many humans will not consider it to be immoral.
15. If contraception is moral, then there is no reason for church doctrinal change on the issue to be correlated with the availability of contraception.
16. Church doctrinal change on the issue is correlated with the availability of contraception.
17. Therefore, unless the correlation is random or spurious, it is more likely that _contraception is immoral_, than that it is moral.

#### Proof from purpose of government

1. The purpose of government is to restrain the evil desires of its citizens via the promise of punishment.
2. The current laws and culture defining the Sexual Marketplace (SMP) allow the evil desires of the participants free reign.
3. Making contraception illegal to produce or sell would severely restrict the free reign of the evil sexual desires of the participants in the SMP.
4. Thus making contracpetion illegal will restrain the evil desires of the citizens.
5. Thus government should make contraception illegal, if it is to fulfill its purpose.
6. But whatever the government should restrain is evil, by definition.
7. Thus _contraception is evil._

Supporting proofs are found below.

## Proof that Natural Law is real

1. Definition of [Natural Law](#definitions)
2. Subjective meaning is incoherent.
3. Thus, if real things are to have meaning at all, that meaning must be objective.
4. If a man cares about anything at all, he attests to the existence of meaning.
    - For no man cares about that which he considers meaningless
5. All men care to some degree about something.
6. Thus all men attest to the existence of objective meaning. (By their actions if not their words)
7. Thus, it is rational to care about any thing if and only if that thing has objective meaning.
8. All things occupy the same universe, and therefore affect, or have the potential to affect each other.
9. Since #8, if it is rational to care about any thing, then it is rational to care about everything. (to some infintesimally small degree)
10. Thus, if it is rational to care about anything, all things have objective meaning.
11. By #5 and #10, unless a man admit that nothing he does or thinks is rational *at all*, all things have objective meaning.
12. But no rational man can admit #11, because it is irrational to believe that rationality does not exist.
13. Thus it is rational to care about things.
14. By #10 and #13, all things have objective meaning.
15. That all things have objective meaning is just a shorter definiton of natural law.
16. Thus natural law is real.

## Proof that using contraception breaks the natural law

1. Sex has two natural purposes: Unity and procreation.
2. Natural law holds that no thing should be used in a manner directly opposed to its natural purpose.
3. Contraception is directly opposed to procreation.
4. Thus contraception breaks natural law.

## Proof that contraception causes self harm

First:

1. Women should be beautiful.
2. Contraception makes women ugly.
    1. Contraception makes women [fatter](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/uotm-sfi030409.php).
    2. Contraception makes women have [ugly voices](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/fertility-women-attractiveness-study_n_2286537.html).
    3. Contraception makes women [move in an unattractive way](http://www.livescience.com/22402-women-dances-ovulation-fertility.html).
    4. Contraception makes women infertile, which, on an instinctual level is [ugly](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200709/the-strippers-secret) to men.
    5. Contraception can make women have acne, have blotchy spots on exposed skin, gain facial hair, and have yellow skin. [source](http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/estrogen-and-progestin-oral-contraceptives-oral-route/side-effects/DRG-20069422)
    6. Contraception increases women's [suicide risk](http://thefederalist.com/2017/12/04/new-study-finds-hormonal-birth-control-triples-womens-risk-suicide/)
3. Delibertately making oneself ugly constitutes self harm.
4. Thus contraception is harmful.

Second:

1. Divorce is harmful.
2. The divorce rate is [highly correlated](http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/divorce-pill.png), in a slightly lagging way, to the use of the oral contraceptives.
3. If there is a causative effect instead of spurious correlation, then contraception causes divorce.
4. Thus, contraception is harmful.

Third:

1. Deliberately increasing one's own risk of harm, without an outweighing benefit, constitutes self-harm.
2. Using contraceptives increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke, heart attack, and blood clots.
3. Thus, unless contraceptives provide an extraordinary benefit outweighing all these risks, contraception is harmful.

Fourth:

1. Deliberately reducing one's own enjoyment, without an outweighing benefit, constitutes self-harm.
2. Using condoms reduces enjoyment of sex.
3. Thus, unless contraceptives provide an extraordinary benefit outweighing the reduction of pleasure, contraception is harmful.

Fifth:

1. Adultery, Divorce, and Fornication are sins.
2. Sins damage one's own relationship with God, which constitutes self-harm.
3. Contraception facilities all these sins, making them easier to engage in.
    1. Socially accepted use of contraception facilitates these sins by making the illusion of consequence-free sexual vice possible. 
    2. Without perceived consequences, people are more likely to sin.
4. Wide-spread acceptance of contraception is highly correlated with wide-spread de-stigmatization of these sins.
5. Thus, to the degree that using contraception makes sin more likely, contraception causes sin.
6. Thus, contraception causes self-harm.

Sixth:

1. Deliberately damaging, or limiting one's intimacy with a spouse is self-harm.
2. Using contraception reduces the likelyhood of children.
3. Producing children tends to keep parents together, which increases (or at least protects) intimacy.
4. Using contraception indicates a desire to keep a fundamental part of the woman, her fertility, out of the relationship.
5. Keeping things out of a relationship limits intimacy.
6. Using contraception implies that a woman is not fit to be a mother, which if said aloud often is an insult.
7. Insulting a spouse damages intimacy.
8. Using contraception either directly, or indirectly damages or limits intimacy with a spouse.


## Definitions

- God: The classical theistic conception of God as Pure Acutality, and Goodness Itself
- Natural Law: The idea that all things have objective essences which exist independent of the things themseleves, and the idea that these essences contain a purpose which all instantiations of the essence exist *for*, and the idea that it is good to realize the purpose of a thing, and bad to frustrate the realization of the purpose of a thing. The fundamental natural law is: the purpose of rationality is the pursuit of what is good and the avoidance of what frustrates the realization of the good.

## Discussions

#### Discussion on proof from extra-marital sex

Objection: 

> that is very consequentialist... "owning guns leads to availability of guns leads to gun-related violence therefore guns are bad." that type of thinking just doesn't have rigor to it imo
> 
> cars promote automobile accidents != cars are bad
> 
> as far as proof is concerned 
> 
> it is still reasonable to avoid an activity that may promote an undesired result

Reply:

> I guess the line you are bringing into question with your car/gun analogy is #3/#4
> 
> actually, the difference with guns is in line #5. widespread acceptance of guns does not imply widespread "gun violence" in the same way that widespread acceptance of contraception implies extra-marital sex
> 
> yeah, it's line #5 that is the crux. Because if any given technology promotes something bad, then it is bad to that degree, but if it promotes something good, then it is good to that degree, and since things can promote multiple things, then they could have a balance of good-effects and bad-effects
> 
> so essentially, for guns, they do necessarily promote some degree of "gun violence" but they also promote good things like hunting, tradition, fun, competition, self-defense, politeness, etc.
> 
> so the argument I made for contraception is true/valid reasoning, it is just not the whole picture. what the final claim should really say is "contraception is bad in this aspect"
> 
> and having shown it is bad in a (large) aspect it would now be burden of proof on some other to show that it is good in an outweighing way or ways

#### Discussion on proof from consequences to self

Objection:

> I question that all contraception causes self harm because:
>  - You only mention self harm for women but men can have vasectomies. How does that make them ugly?
>  - Of the 5 reasons that contraception makes women ugly, it is possible that a woman could experience none of them.

Reply:

> Before answering the specific objections raised, I will answer the general one: Even if not *every* instance of contraception's use leads to self-harm, the fact that in the main it causes self-harm is enough to damn it *in the main.* Which is still a significantly different position than that of the average American, or the average American Christian, or even the average American Christian Catholic.
> 
> In regard to vasectomies: a part of the body is literally made non-functional, constituting self-harm. If a doctor surgically snipped a tendon in my leg, even if I felt no physical pain at the snipping, I would be harmed, because my leg would no longer function. Now, it is a widely accepted principle that self-harm of this sort can be valid as a means to save the whole, but no one gets a vasectomy to save their life. Also, the only guy I knew who had a vasectomy reported non-trivial soreness, swelling, discomfort, and pain lasting for a few days; which all constitute (at least a form of) harm. Which he brought on himself. self-harm.
> 
> There were six separate proofs given that contraception causes self-harm. So even if this objection totally invalidates the first proof, that leaves 5 remaining proofs to contend with.
> 
> However, the mere fact that none of the listed uglifications were *noticed* does not imply that they did not happen, humans being notoriously oblivious.
> 
> However, even if a woman existed who was capable of using oral contraceptives without any damage to her phsyical beauty whatsoever, she would still be rendered infertile, which point 2.iv considers to be ugly.
> 
> However, even if point 2.iv is disagreed with, and infertility is not considered ugly, it is still true that any woman using oral contracpetives would be *risking* all of these aspects of her beauty, which should not be undertaken without a valid, outweighing reason. Selfishness generally not being considered a valid reason.
> 
> However, even if she is not considered to be at risk of any of these detriments to her beauty, she would still be setting a bad example for the more-typical woman who does have to contend with all these factors, and on that reason alone would have a strong barrier to overcome in her defense of her own use.

Objection:

> There are many types of contraception, not just oral.  (IUD'S, condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, etc)  You're saying that all of these make you ugly and do self harm?

Reply:

> If you define loss or suspension of capability as harm, then losing (or suspending) your fertility, in whatever manner, counts as harm.
> 
> If you don't accept that definition, then I would have to concede that it is possible that those other methods do not apply to the "makes women ugly" form of the proof that contraception causes self harm. But there are still 5 other proofs supporting the claim "contraception causes self-harm." The proofs from divorce, risk, reduced pleasure, other sin, and insult would still apply to all the forms of contraception. Furthermore, oral contraceptives are the prevailing method in use among steady partners, so it is still significant to show that using those are immoral/a bad idea.

Objection:

> You say that using contraception makes women ugly, but having babies causes women to look ugly as well. The stress of pregnancy and motherhood, contributes to aging, and the young always look better than the old.

Reply:

> Assume both are true: that contraception makes women ugly and childbirth makes them ugly.
> 
> In this case, the logic against contraception is not affected, because any given women can simply abstain from sex if she wishes not to have children. Phrased another way, no premise or logical extrapolation listed in the proof is invalidated by the (assumed) true fact that childbirth can cause women to look uglier.

#### Discussion on proof from existence of God

Objection:

> I do not think that evil is a privation of good, because humans can choose between good and evil. The fact of human choice allows humans to create evil, therefore evil exists and is not a privation.

Reply:

> The fact of human choice implies that they are able to create things which are less than perfect. But this lack of perfection is just what we refer to when we say "evil." Thus evil remains best understood as a privation of good.
> 
> Humans themselves are contingent beings. We cannot create anything soley of ourselves, thus everything we cause to exist must find it's most fundamental cause in God. If we consider that God is good, we must then either reconcile the seemingly contradictory statements that something Purely Good creates something evil, or we must consider that evil as such does not actually exist. If evil is merely imperfection, or the absence of Good, then it is at least plausible that something Purely Good could create something that is only partially good. God created everything, "and He saw that it was good."
