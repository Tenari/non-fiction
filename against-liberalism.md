# Against Liberalism

## Proofs

#### Proof by definition of government

1. [**Government**](#definitions) is a discriminating authority which initiates force to support a particular conception of the good.
2. Two things are equal if there is no distinction between them.
3. Discrimination is the act of making (or recognizing) a distinction between two things.
4. Equality is central to the principal of Liberalism.
5. By replacement, Liberalism is the political doctrine that securing a lack of distinction between rights is the primary legitimate purpose of a distinction-making authority.
6. Thus Liberalism is incoherent.

#### Proof by freedom

1. [Liberalism](#definitions) requires that securing individual freedom is the primary purpose of government.
2. Every government must make laws.
3. Every law restricts available choices.
4. The number of available choices is proportional to the number of humans who have freedom and inversely proportional to the number and applicability of the laws.
5. Therefore every law the government makes restricts individual freedom.
6. By replacement, Liberalism requires that the primary purpose of governemnt is to secure individual freedom by restricting individual freedom.
7. Therefore Liberalism is incoherent.

#### Proof by rights

1. [Liberalism](#definitions) requires that all citizens hold equal [rights](#definitions).
2. Assume subject A has concrete right X.
    1. Alan has the right to wear this sock.
3. By #1, subject B must also have concrete right X.
    1. Bob must also have the right to wear this sock.
4. By definition, a right can only be possessed by one entity. "An individual"
    1. Both Alan and Bob cannot wear the same sock at the same time.
5. Thus, it is impossible for subject A and subject B to both have concrete right X.
6. Thus Liberalism requires the impossible.
7. Thus Liberalism is the political doctrine that acheiving the impossible is the primary legitimate purpose of government.
8. But nothing impossible can be the primary purpose of anything coherent.
9. Therefore Liberalism is incoherent.

#### Proof by contradiction

1. [Definition of liberalism](#definitions)
2. Every right has subjects whose choices must be limited by that right.
    - By replacement this could also read: Every discriminating authority has subjects who must be obliged to choose *x* rather than *y*.
3. Thus if the government grants an individual a right, it limits the available choices of the subjects to that right.
4. By definition, if the government grants a right, it limits the freedom of the subjects to that right.
5. If #4, then it is impossible for the government to both secure freedom and equal rights, for increasing one necessarily reduces the other.
6. But nothing impossible can be the primary purpose of anything coherent.
7. Therefore Liberalism is incoherent.

## Definitions

- **Liberalism** is the political doctrine that securing individual freedom and equal rights is the primary legitimate purpose of government.
- **Freedom** is the capacity to actually choose what we wish to choose.
- A **right** is a specific discriminating authority possessed by an individual; for example a property right discriminates between the owner and the trespasser, treating the former’s claims as authoritative over the latter’s claims.
- **Equal**: the same. Equivalent. Identical.
- **Authority** is a moral capacity to oblige a subject to choose this thing rather than that.
- A **subject** is an individual.
- **Government** is a discriminating authority which initiates force to support a particular conception of the good.
