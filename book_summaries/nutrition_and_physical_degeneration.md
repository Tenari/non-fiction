# Nutrition and Physical Degeneration

*A Comparison of Primitice and Modern Diets and Their Effects*

by Weston Price

## One Sentence Summary

Modern processed food that is high in sugar and low in vitamins does not have enough nutritional value to adequately promote the development of human bodies, which is most important in utero, and through childhood; thus effective supplementation, or just higher nutritional content food must be chosen to achieve genetic health potential.

## One Paragraph Summary

### Why Seek Wisdom from Primitive Races

Because some isloated primitive people have avoided certain health problems caused from modern diets and lifestyle. By comparing and contrasting isolated vs modernized people from the same racial group, it makes clear what health problems are introduced by modernity specifically, and highlights the specific causes. The problems he is looking at are: tooth decay, general physical degeneration, facial/dental-arch defromities, and character changes. He is also focused on reducing the number of problems caused during pregnancy by lack of necessary nutrition.

> These data reveal and average increase in susceptibility of thirty-five fold [when primitive groups become modernized]

in specific reference to "dental caries" (cavities/tooth decay)

> Thinking is as biologic as is digestion

which suggests that fixing nutritional problems will solve some phsycological/moral problems.

### The Progressive Decline of Modern Civilization

Modern man is declining in physical fitness. We require large numbers of doctors, and many people spend a lot of time sick/incapacitated due to health issues. incidence of heart disease in New York City have increased from 203.7 / 100k in 1907 to 327.2 / 100k in 1936 (an increase of 60% in 3 decades).

Stats are cited to show that there is a very large portion of morons around, and that intellectual decay is occurring, as well as an increase in delinquency /moral decay. 

Blah blah blah people are degenerating, and their societies with them.

chemical data of food analyzed in chpt 15

final paragraphs from chapter:

> High immunity to dental caries, freedom from deformity of the dental arches and face, and sturdy physiques with high immunity to disease were all found associated with physical isolation, and with forced limitation in selection of foods. This resulted in a very liberal use of dairy products and whole-rye bread, in connection with plant foods, and with meat served about once a week.

> The individuals in the modernized districs were found to have widespread tooth decay. Many had facial and dental arch deformities and much susceptibility to diseases.

### Characteristics of Primitive and Modernized Dietaries

Evaluate primitive diets on basis of known biologic requirements, and test their primitive diets by "applying their equivalents to our modern families".

Use the generally accepted minimal + optimal amounts of vitamins/minerals needed for health as a yardstick for evaluating primitive diets.

Divide nutrition between "body building"(like growth and health, not competivie muscle men) materials and "energy units". Modern people generally stop eating when they get enough "energy units" regardless of if they actually got enough "body building" materials. Big difference between body-building material required by a growing child or a pregnant mom or an average sedentary adult.
