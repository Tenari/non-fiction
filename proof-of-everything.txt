GOAL OF THIS DOCUMENT:
  This is a plan for the creation of a youtube series which purports to show why everyone should be a Catholic.
    - The series will start with one monster video, which lists, in overview form, a logical train that starts from the obvious observations of our senses and ends up with everyone being a Catholic. This video will contain links at each point to other, shorter videos which defend that point. It will start with a prelim about "analogical language" and attitude toward belief, and admittance of my personal biases, and an explanation of how the video works. It will feature a lot of words onscreen as if the screen were a whiteboard. My annoying voice will be the lecture.
    - each support video will lay out the case for what this point means, and why it is true. then it will attempt to forsee and answer objections.

===

Reality is divided by Potency and Act
The things of our everyday experience require some thing composed of Pure Act to keep their potential for existence actualized.
Thus, God, who is Pure Act, exists.
Pure Act is necessarily singular, because it cannot have any feature to distinguish it from any other Pure Act without having the potential to have that feature (or not have it) and violating the definition of Pure Act.
Pure Act is necessarily immaterial, because material has the potential to be in different locations, which is potentiality, which violates the definition of Pure Act.
etc for all the primary attributes of God.

1. I am real.
2. I can change.
3. Change entails some potential becoming real.
4. By 2 and 3, I must have potential.
5. By 1 and 4, I am composed of Reality and Potentiality.
6. Potentials can only be made real by some already real thing. (Because potentials are not fully real, and have no direct causal power)
7. I was not always real.
8. By 1 and 7, my existence is a potential that was made real.



Thus God is pure Act, which is unchanging, the cause of the existence of things, singular (or unique), immaterial, eternal, perfect, omnipotent, and omniscient.

3. If a thing can change, it is a mixture of potency and act.
4. 


observe reality
abstract from reality to a deeper understanding
extrapolate from that deeper understanding to the necessary unmoved mover
examine the nature of the unmoved mover to understand its qualities
Realize that the existence of the God of classical theism means that miracles are possible
    But on the other hand, the doctrine of divine concurrence tells us that since this entire natural order operates only insofar as the divine primary cause concurs with it, there is also the possibility of a supernatural order of things -- an order of things over and above the natural order, for the sake of which the latter might be suspended.  (Notice that “supernatural” here has a technical meaning that is unrelated to the sorts of things popular usage of the word suggests.  It has nothing to do with vampires, werewolves, zombies, and the like -- which, if they existed, would be part of the “natural” order in the relevant sense, rather than supernatural.) Now both of these ideas -- that some things are impossible given just the natural order of secondary causes, but that the divine primary cause might act in a supernatural way -- entail the possibility of miracles.
Use our deeper understanding of reality to analyze the human condition and conclude on the existence and immoratality of the soul, together with the possibility of resurrection
    The Scholastic argues that the human soul is to be conceived of as the substantial form of the living human being, related to the body as form to matter.  The intellectual and volitional powers of the soul are, it is argued, essentially immaterial, operating without direct dependence on any bodily organ.  This in turn leads to the conclusion that the human soul is naturally immortal.  For since the intellect and will do not directly depend on the body when a human being is alive, they do not perish with the death of the body.  Hence the human soul, reduced to its intellectual and volitional powers, carries on after the loss of our corporeal functions. https://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=acpq_2013_0087_0001_0001_0032&file_type=pdf
Analyze human psychology of passions vs will to see that most humans would need special revelation to know and follow God
"The only way to know some revelation was true, is if it were certified with a miracle that could only come from God"
Compare the religions of the world, and see that the only three that fit with what we have said are I,J,C and that I < J < C because of miracles
  here evidence of Jesus from Case for Christ or WLCraig et al is useful
Now observe that there are very many christian denominations and realize that we should analyze which is true
  Historical/early Christian worship, Authority, anti-solas, sexual morality, etc
Conclude that everyone should be a Catholic because it is true

    POINT BELOW
  If you don't know what I'm talking about, just keep watching. The point of this video is to give an outline of the rational chain that leads, step by step, to the conclusion that every person should become a Catholic. I start with the most uncontroversial premise I can imagine, but at each point along the way the odds of you disagreeing, or misunderstanding go up. So, each link in this chain has an attendant shorter clip where I explain what the point means, why I think it's true, and respond to common objections. Those videos are where the meat of the argumentation and support for my reasoning will lie. This video is just the outline. If you understand and agree with each statement, they lead logically to the conclusion that the Catholic Church is what she claims she is--the One True Bride of Christ.
    ANIMATE BASIC LOGICAL CHAIN WHILE IM TALKING
  Now, am I a genius? No. Am I even a trained philosopher, or logician? No. Might I be wrong? Yes. Of course, I don't think I'm wrong, but my own nature as a finite human being, along with my memories of having been wrong before, leads me to the conclusion that it is at least *possible* that I am wrong. A man I admire once advised me to "hold my beliefs loosely" to allow new ones in and see if they fit. While I don't always live up to that standard, I do at least try, and so I would ask the same thing of you. You may be an atheist, with a strong conviction that religion is nothing more than ridiculous superstition. You may be a born-again young-earth creationist, who knows in his heart of hearts that the literal interpretation of the Bible is the only Truth. You may have some eastern philosophy that I have no understanding of. Fine. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm wrong. But it might go the other way as well. Think to yourself for a moment how deeply ingrained your current beliefs are, and ask yourself if it is even possible for you to consider evidence which challenges them? Try to hold your beliefs loosely, so that the truth can make itself known to you.
  When you're watching this outline, I suggest, pausing it after every numbered point that I make, and thinking about it for a second or two. If it seems obviously false, then click into the defense video, where hopefully I can explain it better. If it seems true, though, press play, and see where the next step leads you.
  Lets' begin.

OUTLINE:

  Now that we've gotten to something that we are calling "God," even if that thing is ill-defined and does not seem much like what most people think God is, it would be a good time to discuss our use of language in relation to God. 
  UNIVOCAL - using words in exactly the same way. I "hit" you, you "hit" me. "Hit" is being used in the same exact sense here.
  EQUIVOCAL - using words in totally different ways. A "bat" flies away. I swing the baseball "bat." "Bat" is being used in totally different senses here.
  ANALOGICAL - using words in similar ways. This cheeseburger is good. This movie is good. You are a good person. "Good" is being used in a similar, but not exactly the same, sense here.
  When we talk about God, we can only really use analogical language, because he is so fundamentally different from our ordinary everyday experience. So when we say God is Good, we do not, and cannot, mean he is Good in exactly the same way that you or I might be Good. Keeping that in mind, let's analyze the attributes of God.





syllogisms leading to God

A thing is composite if it is composed of more than one distinct part.
I am composed of more than one distinct part.
---
I am composite.
A composite thing exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment.
---
I exist at any moment only insofar as my parts are combined at that moment.
Two (or more) parts can be combined only where there is a concurrently combining cause.
---
I exist at any moment only insofar as a concurrent cause keeps my parts combined.
If a thing exists only insofar as a concurrent cause keeps its parts combined, that thing is "being caused to exist."
---
I am being caused to exist.
A cause may be composite, or be absolutely simple (having no parts, even metaphysical ones).
    put the definition of "absolutely simple" in smaller side font on screen
---
I am either being caused to exist by composite causes, or by an absolutely simple cause.
God is absolutely simple.
---
I am either being caused to exist by composite causes, or by God.
If I am being caused to exsit by God, God exists.
---
Either God exists, or I am being caused to exist by composite causes.
  Hold on to that one for now. (keep the "Either God Exists or" on the screen)

I am being caused to exist by composite causes.
Composite causes in turn require a cause of their own existence at any moment that they exist.
---
I am being caused to exist by composite causes, which in turn require a cause of their own existence at any moment that they exist.
A causal chain is when an effect is produced by a cause, which is itself produced by a cause.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain at any moment that I exist.
A causal chain is chronological if it occurs over some span of time.
---
I am not being caused to exist at any given moment by a chronological causal chain.

  lets try again (do a rewind effect)

I am being caused to exist by a causal chain at any moment that I exist.
A causal chain is hierarchical if it is composed of a concurrent series of causes acting all in one moment.
---
I am being caused to exist by a hierarchical causal chain.
A hierarchical causal chain must have a beginning.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning.
The beginning of a chain of composite causes must not itself be composite.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning, which is not itself composite.
A thing is absolutely simple if it is "not composite."
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning, which is absolutely simple.
God is absolutely simple.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain which begins with God.
If a causal chain beginning with God exists, then God exists.
---
THUS
God exists.

syllogisms that expand on the attributes of God.

God is the absolutely simple cause of the exsitence of composite things.
Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles.
---
God is pure act.
There could be more than one thing of pure act only if there were some differentiating feature that one had and another lacked.
Having such a differentiating feature would entail having some unactualized potential.
Pure act cannot have an unactualized potential, by definition.
So there must be only one thing of pure act.
If there is only one thing of a kind, it is unique.
---
God is unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.
Something is "unchanging" when it cannot in principle change.
Change is the actualization of potential.
Pure act has no potential to actualize.
Pure act cannot in principle change.
---
God is unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.
Material things always have the potential to change location.
Pure act has no potential to actualize.
---
God is immaterial, unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.
A thing either exists necessarily, due to its essence, or it has a potential for existence which is actualized.
Pure act cannot have its potential for existence actualized, because it would then have potential and not be pure act.
Pure act exists necessarily, intrinsically to its essence.
If something exists necessarily, it cannot not exist, which means it always has and always will exist, which means it exists eternally.
---
God is immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.
Something is perfect if there is no part of its nature which it fails to fulfill.
A thing fails to fulfill part of its nature if it has some unactualized potential which it should actualize.
Something is perfect if there is no unactualized potential which it should actualize.
Pure act has no potentials, thus no unactualized potential which it should actualize.
---
God is perfect, immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.
A thing is omnipotent if it can cause any possible change.
Every change that could occur, would necessarily have God as its first cause.
---
God is omnipotent, perfect, immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.
No cause can actualize what it does not actually have (immanently or formally)
Since God actualizes all actual things, he must have all things "inside" himself in some way.
Since God is immaterial, the way that he has all things inside himself must be like knowledge.
Thus, God knows all things.
A thing is omniscient if it knows all things.
---
THUS
God is omniscient, omnipotent, perfect, immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.

syllogisms leading to Christianity

Minds are immaterial.
Humans have minds.
---
Humans have an immaterial aspect to their being.
Material reality cannot create immaterial reality.
---
Humans have an aspect to their being which was not created by material reality.
God is immaterial, and capable of creation of all things.
---
Humans have an aspect to their being which was created directly by God.
If God must directly act to create human beings, God cares about human beings to some special degree.
---
God cares about human beings to some special degree.
    hold this thought

Humans have an immaterial aspect to their being. (rewind effect to here)
Immaterial beings, by definition, exist without a body.
---
Humans have an aspect of their being that is not dependent upon a body.
If something is not dependent upon a body, it can continue to exist without a body.
--
Humans have an aspect of their being that can continue to exist without a body.
Death is loss of the physical body.
---
The immaterial human mind can continue to exist after physical, bodily death.
    hold this thought

A miracle is a supernatural event.
An event is supernatural if it displays some effect beyond what the natural order of secondary causes is capable of.
---
A miracle is an event displaying some effect beyond what the natural order of secondary causes is capable of.
God is capable of causing effects beyond what the natural order of secondary causes is cabaple of.
---
Miracles are possible in principle.
   hold this thought

(both from before)
Miracles are possible in principle.
The immaterial human mind can continue to exist after physical, bodily death.
---
Resurrection by supernatural miracle could be acheived by rejoining an immaterial human mind to its body.
    replace the previous two with this held thought

Humans struggle to be rational, often having their will overridden by their passions.
The rational arguments in favor of God's existence are complex.
---
Humans will struggle to discover and understand the rational arguments in favor of God's existence on their own.
Humans understand special revelation and teaching.
---
Special revelation is often necessary for humans to know God.
If God cares about human beings to some special degree, He would do what is necessary for them to know of Him.
---
If God cares about human beings to some special degree, it is reasonable that He would reveal himself to humans.
God cares about human beings to some special degree. (from before)
---
It is reasonable that God would reveal himself to humans.
There is material gain, and other incentives, for humans to falsely claim divine inspiration.
---
Any true revelation of God needs to be backed by some miracle only God is capable of performing, in order to be trusted.
Resurrection by supernatural miracle could be acheived by rejoining an immaterial human mind to its body. (from before)
---
Any revelation of God backed by resurrection from the dead is trustworthy.
    Hold this

If some religion understands God correctly (insert bullets), holds that resurrection of the body is possible, and backs its claims of divine revelation by reference to supernatural miracles, then that religion is true.
Islam, Judaism, and Christianity understand God correctly, hold that resurrection of the body is possible, and claim miracles as certification.
---
At least one of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity is true.
Islam's main miracle attestation is the Quran itself, which is not obviously actually only something doable by God.
---
Islam is unlikely to be true.
    animate rewind effect

At least one of -Islam-, Judaism, and Christianity is true.
Judiasm does not attest to any miracles that Christianity does not accept, so if there is a credible miracle in Christianity that is not in Judiasm, then Christianity is true.
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is historically credible.
---
Christianity is more "certified" by God than any other religion, and thus, the True Religion.

syllogisms leading to Catholicism

The True Bride of Christ is the branch of Christianity which:
1. was founded by Jesus Christ
2. has not abandoned or altered his teaching
3. was given his authority
4. has evidence of many miracles
5. cannot be destroyed
6. 

The doctrines of the Catholic Church are
  in accord with the words of the early church
  immutable
  logically coherent

  The doctrine of the eucharist, contraception, divorce, and biblical inerrancy all favor the Catholic Church.

The facts of history favor the Catholic Church
  rebellion
  continuity
  tradition
  miracles

=====
There are many branches of Christianity, which all hold mutually exclusive doctrines to be true.
Two branches which hold mutually exclusive doctrines, cannot both be correct.
---
There is at most one branch of Christianity which has correct doctrine.
Having correct doctrine is a prerequisite for being the One True Church of Christ.
---
There is at most one branch of Christianity which is the One True Church of Christ.
=====

=====
Heresy has the character of being a myopic simplification of a complex web of ideas into one single truth blown all out of proportion.
Upon examination, all Protestant denominations fit the simplification pattern of heresy.
---
All Protestant denominations are likely heretical.
Christians should not be a part of a heretical denomination.
---
Christians should not be a part of a Protestant denomination.
=====

=====
Christians hold that a man called Christ lived and died and lived again around the year 30.
The evidence for Christ's resurrection comes almost entirely from the testimony of the magesterium of the Catholic Church.
---
Christians believe in Christ's resurrection, based on the word of the magesterium of the Catholic Church.
It is irrational to believe something based on the evidence of an entity whose witness you do not trust.
---
To believe in Christ's resurrection, but to reject the magesterium of the Catholic Church is irrational.
To accept the magesterium of the Catholic Church is to become Catholic.
---
Christians should become Catholic to rationally believe in Christ's resurrection.
=====

=====
If a church was founded directly by Jesus Christ, then that church is the one true church of Christ.
Jesus Christ founded the Catholic Church in the year 33AD.
---
The Catholic Church is the one true church of Christ.
=====

=====
The one true church of Christ must not change its settled doctrines, for truth does not change.
The Catholic Church has not changed any settled doctrines.
---
The Catholic Church fits this criteria for being the one true bride of Christ.
=====

1. Christians are members of the Church, which was established by Jesus and his disciples.
2. The Church is the company of all Christians regarded as a spiritual body.
3. No spiritual body can function properly when its various members regard each other as false, or not a part of the body.
4. Thus if the Church is to function properly, its members must regard each other as a part of the same body.
5. Protestants and Catholics generally do not regard each other as part of the same body.
7. Thus if the Church is to function properly, Protestants and Catholics must merge to become one body.
8. If a group splits, where one side of the split does not want the split to occur, and the other does, then one side is the original, and the other is the rebel.
9. Protestants desired to establish their own, distinct body, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Protestants are the rebels.
10. Catholics desired to keep Protestants together, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Catholics are the original.
11. When two groups merge, if one is the original, and one is the rebel, the rebel must submit to the original. This is called Repentance.
12. Thus, if Protestants and Catholics must merge, Protestants must submit to Catholics, in repentance.
13. By #7 and #12, if the Church is to function properly, Protestants must submit to Catholics in repentance.
14. All Protestants should desire the Church to function properly.
15. Thus all Protestants should join the Catholic Church.




===========================

Shorter clip scripts:

"A thing is composite if it is composed of more than one distinct part."

You disagree with this? Really? *sigh* This is basically just a definition of a term. The dictionary definition of "composite" is "made up of distinct parts or elements," so I don't think my definition is far off from common usage. I suppose you could object to the idea of "things" as real at all. You might say that nothing is actually composed of multiple parts, so nothing is actually composite. You might hold that the things that appear to be composite are actually not things, just an aggregate of individual parts which give the illusion of being a single "thing." But at that point you're left denying the existence of rocks and trees as real things in the world, against the great mass of human experience and use of language. Maybe you're right, but I think that position is so radical it's indistinguishable from absurdity.

"I am composed of more than one distinct part."

What is the hand if not a part of the body? What is the eye? Do we not all learn of the parts of the body? Even our constituent atoms have parts, else the atom could not be split. Further, there are (on the classical account of humanity) immaterial parts of a human substance, namely rationality. It is absurd to deny that humans are composed of parts.

"I am composite."

This follows directly from the previous two premises. If you accept the definition of composite, and accept that I (and really all humans) meet that definition, then it necessarily follows that "I am composite." Denying the conclusion while accepting the premises is irrational.

"A composite thing exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment."

This means that since a composite thing is composed of parts, then when those parts are not combined, that thing cannot be said to exist. I am a fully functional human right now, but if all my constituent parts are separated, I can hardly be said to still exist. Being chopped into pieces has the reliable effect of killing people. To have it's parts combined at any moment, is just what it means for a composite thing to exist.

"I exist at any moment only insofar as my parts are combined at that moment."

This follows directly from the previous two premises. If you accept the definition of a composite thing's existence, and accept that I am composite, then it necessarily follows that "I exist at any moment only insofar as my parts are combined at that moment." Denying the conclusion while accepting the premises is irrational.

"Two (or more) parts can be combined only where there is a concurrently combining cause."
