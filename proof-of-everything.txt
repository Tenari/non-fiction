GOAL OF THIS DOCUMENT:
  This is a plan for the creation of a youtube series which purports to show why everyone should be a Catholic.
    - The series will start with one monster video, which lists, in overview form, a logical train that starts from the obvious observations of our senses and ends up with everyone being a Catholic. This video will contain links at each point to other, shorter videos which defend that point. It will start with a prelim about "analogical language" and attitude toward belief, and admittance of my personal biases, and an explanation of how the video works. It will feature a lot of words onscreen as if the screen were a whiteboard. My annoying voice will be the lecture.
    - each support video will lay out the case for what this point means, and why it is true. then it will attempt to forsee and answer objections.

Reality is divided by Potency and Act
The things of our everyday experience require some thing composed of Pure Act to keep their potential for existence actualized.
Thus, God, who is Pure Act, exists.
Pure Act is necessarily singular, because it cannot have any feature to distinguish it from any other Pure Act without having the potential to have that feature (or not have it) and violating the definition of Pure Act.
Pure Act is necessarily immaterial, because material has the potential to be in different locations, which is potentiality, which violates the definition of Pure Act.
etc for all the primary attributes of God.

1. I am real.
2. I can change.
3. Change entails some potential becoming real.
4. By 2 and 3, I must have potential.
5. By 1 and 4, I am composed of Reality and Potentiality.
6. Potentials can only be made real by some already real thing. (Because potentials are not fully real, and have no direct causal power)
7. I was not always real.
8. By 1 and 7, my existence is a potential that was made real.


Thus God is pure Act, which is unchanging, the cause of the existence of things, singular (or unique), immaterial, eternal, perfect, omnipotent, and omniscient.


observe reality
abstract from reality to a deeper understanding
extrapolate from that deeper understanding to the necessary unmoved mover
examine the nature of the unmoved mover to understand its qualities
Realize that the existence of the God of classical theism means that miracles are possible
    But on the other hand, the doctrine of divine concurrence tells us that since this entire natural order operates only insofar as the divine primary cause concurs with it, there is also the possibility of a supernatural order of things -- an order of things over and above the natural order, for the sake of which the latter might be suspended.  (Notice that “supernatural” here has a technical meaning that is unrelated to the sorts of things popular usage of the word suggests.  It has nothing to do with vampires, werewolves, zombies, and the like -- which, if they existed, would be part of the “natural” order in the relevant sense, rather than supernatural.) Now both of these ideas -- that some things are impossible given just the natural order of secondary causes, but that the divine primary cause might act in a supernatural way -- entail the possibility of miracles.
Use our deeper understanding of reality to analyze the human condition and conclude on the existence and immoratality of the soul, together with the possibility of resurrection
    The Scholastic argues that the human soul is to be conceived of as the substantial form of the living human being, related to the body as form to matter.  The intellectual and volitional powers of the soul are, it is argued, essentially immaterial, operating without direct dependence on any bodily organ.  This in turn leads to the conclusion that the human soul is naturally immortal.  For since the intellect and will do not directly depend on the body when a human being is alive, they do not perish with the death of the body.  Hence the human soul, reduced to its intellectual and volitional powers, carries on after the loss of our corporeal functions. https://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=acpq_2013_0087_0001_0001_0032&file_type=pdf
Analyze human psychology of passions vs will to see that most humans would need special revelation to know and follow God
"The only way to know some revelation was true, is if it were certified with a miracle that could only come from God"
Compare the religions of the world, and see that the only three that fit with what we have said are I,J,C and that I < J < C because of miracles
  here evidence of Jesus from Case for Christ or WLCraig et al is useful
Now observe that there are very many christian denominations and realize that we should analyze which is true
  Historical/early Christian worship, Authority, anti-solas, sexual morality, etc
Conclude that everyone should be a Catholic because it is true

    POINT BELOW
  If you don't know what I'm talking about, just keep watching. The point of this video is to give an outline of the rational chain that leads, step by step, to the conclusion that every person should become a Catholic. I start with the most uncontroversial premise I can imagine, but at each point along the way the odds of you disagreeing, or misunderstanding go up. So, each link in this chain has an attendant shorter clip where I explain what the point means, why I think it's true, and respond to common objections. Those videos are where the meat of the argumentation and support for my reasoning will lie. This video is just the outline. If you understand and agree with each statement, they lead logically to the conclusion that the Catholic Church is what she claims she is--the One True Bride of Christ.
    ANIMATE BASIC LOGICAL CHAIN WHILE IM TALKING
  Now, am I a genius? No. Am I even a trained philosopher, or logician? No. Might I be wrong? Yes. Of course, I don't think I'm wrong, but my own nature as a finite human being, along with my memories of having been wrong before, leads me to the conclusion that it is at least *possible* that I am wrong. A man I admire once advised me to "hold my beliefs loosely" to allow new ones in and see if they fit. While I don't always live up to that standard, I do at least try, and so I would ask the same thing of you. You may be an atheist, with a strong conviction that religion is nothing more than ridiculous superstition. You may be a born-again young-earth creationist, who knows in his heart of hearts that the literal interpretation of the Bible is the only Truth. You may have some eastern philosophy that I have no understanding of. Fine. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm wrong. But it might go the other way as well. Think to yourself for a moment how deeply ingrained your current beliefs are, and ask yourself if it is even possible for you to consider evidence which challenges them? Try to hold your beliefs loosely, so that the truth can make itself known to you.
  When you're watching this outline, I suggest, pausing it after every numbered point that I make, and thinking about it for a second or two. If it seems obviously false, then click into the defense video, where hopefully I can explain it better. If it seems true, though, press play, and see where the next step leads you.
  Lets' begin.

OUTLINE:

syllogisms leading to God

A thing is composite if it is composed of more than one distinct part.
I am composed of more than one distinct part.
---
I am composite.
A composite thing exists at any moment only because its parts are combined at that moment.
---
I exist at any moment only because my parts are combined at that moment.
Two (or more) parts can be combined only where there is a concurrently combining cause.
---
I exist at any moment only because a concurrent cause keeps my parts combined.
If a thing exists only because a concurrent cause keeps its parts combined, that thing is "being caused to exist."
---
I am being caused to exist.
A cause may be composite, or be absolutely simple (having no parts, even metaphysical ones).
    put the definition of "absolutely simple" in smaller side font on screen
---
I am either being caused to exist by composite causes, or by an absolutely simple cause.
By definition, anything absolutely simple is called God.
---
I am either being caused to exist by composite causes, or by God.
If I am being caused to exsit by God, God exists.
---
Either God exists, or I am being caused to exist by composite causes.
  Hold on to that one for now. (keep the "Either God Exists or" on the screen)

I am being caused to exist by composite causes.
Composite causes in turn require a cause of their own existence at any moment that they exist.
---
I am being caused to exist by composite causes, which in turn require a cause of their own existence at any moment that they exist.
A causal chain is when an effect is produced by a cause, which is itself produced by a cause.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain at any single moment that I exist.
A causal chain is chronological if it occurs over some series of moments.
---
I am being caused to exist by a non-chronological causal chain at any single moment that I exist.

  lets try again (do a rewind effect)

I am being caused to exist by a causal chain at any moment that I exist.
A causal chain is hierarchical if it is composed of a concurrent series of causes acting all in one moment.
---
I am being caused to exist by a hierarchical causal chain.
A hierarchical causal chain must have a beginning.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning.
The beginning of a chain of composite causes must not itself be composite.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning, which is not itself composite.
A thing is absolutely simple if it is "not composite."
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning, which is absolutely simple.
God is absolutely simple.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain which begins with God.
If a causal chain beginning with God exists, then God exists.
---
THUS
God exists.

  God image -> survey says meme
  Now we've gotten to something called "God," but that thing is ill-defined and seems far removed from what most people think God is. After all, when you ask "what is God?" the answer "Absolutely Simple" is going to be pretty far down on the survey results list. But, before we go on to discover more attributes of God in order to make him match the common understanding better, we should discuss our use of language in relation to God. 
  There are 3 ways to use words:
    UNIVOCAL - using words in exactly the same way. I "hit" you, you "hit" me. "Hit" is being used in the same exact sense here.
    EQUIVOCAL - using words in totally different ways. A "bat" flies away. I swing the baseball "bat." "Bat" is being used in totally different senses here.
    ANALOGICAL - using words in similar ways. This cheeseburger is good. This movie is good. You are a good person. "Good" is being used in a similar, but not exactly identical, sense here. All three really are good, but their goodness is not exactly identical.
  When we talk about God, we can only really use analogical language, because he is so fundamentally different from our ordinary everyday experience. So when we say God is Good, we do not, and cannot, mean he is Good in exactly the same way that you or I might be good. Keeping that in mind, let's analyze the attributes of God.

==========

syllogisms that expand on the attributes of God.

When we left off, we had discovered an absolutely simple cause of the existence of things, that we called God. But the God of classical theism, and Catholicism more specifically, has quite a few other features. So we can't really say we've proven God exists until we prove that God has these features. According to classical theism, God is:
[ ] omniscient
[ ] omnipotent
[ ] perfect
[ ] immaterial
[ ] eternal
[ ] unchanging
[ ] unique
[ ] pure act
[x] absolutely simple
[x] the cause of the existence of composite things

Let's do pure act first.

God is the absolutely simple cause of the exsitence of composite things. => rephrase to "God is not composite"
Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles.
---
    God is pure act.

This can only make sense if you understand the idea of Potency and Act, and why it is necessary, so I highly reccommend clicking into the support video if you're the least bit confused. What follows will depend heavily on this concept.

There could be multiple "pure acts" only if one had some differentiating feature that another lacked.
Lacking such a differentiating feature entails having some unactualized potential.
---
There could be multiple "pure acts" only if there were some unactualized potential that one had.
Pure act cannot have an unactualized potential, by definition.
---
There could not be multiple "pure acts."
If there cannot be multiple of something, it is unique.
---
    God is unique. (pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

Something is "unchanging" when it cannot in principle change.
Change is the actualization of potential.
---
Something is "unchanging" when it cannot in principle have a potential actualized.
Pure act has no potential to have actualized.
---
    God is unchanging (, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

A thing either exists necessarily, or it has a potential for existence which is actualized.
Pure act has no potential to actualize (, including the potential for existence.)
---
Pure act exists necessarily.
If something exists necessarily, it cannot fail to exist.
---
Pure act cannot fail to exist.
If something cannot fail to exist, it must always have existed and always continue to exist.
---
Pure act must always have existed and always continue to exist.
If something must always have existed and always continue to exist, it exists eternally.
---
Pure act exists eternally.
    God is eternal, ( unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

Material things always have the potential to change location.
Pure act has no potential to actualize.
---
Pure act is not material.
Something that is "not material" is immaterial.
---
Pure act is immaterial.
    God is immaterial (, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

Something is perfect if there is no part of its nature which it fails to fulfill.
A thing fails to fulfill part of its nature if it has some unactualized potential which it should actualize.
---
Something is perfect if there is no unactualized potential which it should actualize.
Pure act has no potentials. (thus no unactualized potential which it should actualize.)
---
Pure act is perfect.
    God is perfect (, immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

Change is the actualization of potential.
Only something already actual can actualize potentials.
---
Every change that could occur must caused by something already actual.
Something can only be "already actual" if it is pure act, or if its potential for existence is being actualized.
---
Every change that could occur must either be directly caused by pure act, or be caused by something whose potential for existence is being actualized by pure act.
If some change is caused by something whose potential for existence is being actualized by pure act, then pure act is the ultimate cause of that change.
---
Every change that could occur must ultimately be caused by pure act, either directly or indirectly.
If every change that could occur must be ultimately caused by pure act, then pure act can cause every change that could occur.
---
Pure act can cause every change that could occur.
A thing is omnipotent if it can cause every change that could occur (aka any logically possible change).
---
Pure act is omnipotent.
    God is omnipotent (, perfect, immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

No cause can actualize what it does not actually have (immanently or formally) in itself.
God actualizes all actual things.
---
God has all things "inside" himself in some way.
Something can be inside another thing either materially, or immaterially like how the mind contains knowledge.
---
God has all things "inside" himself either materially, or immaterially like how the mind contains knowledge.
God is immaterial.
---
The way God has all things inside himself must be like knowledge.
rephrase to: God knows all things.
A thing is omniscient if it knows all things.
---
    God is omniscient (, omnipotent, perfect, immaterial, eternally unchanging, unique pure act, absolutely simple, and the cause of the exsitence of composite things.)

syllogisms leading to Christianity

Minds are immaterial.
Humans have minds.
---
Humans have an immaterial aspect to their being.
Material reality cannot create immaterial reality.
---
Humans have an aspect to their being which was not created by material reality.
God is immaterial, and capable of creation of all things.
---
Humans have an aspect to their being which was created directly by God.
If God must directly act to create human beings, God cares about human beings to some special degree.
---
God cares about human beings to some special degree.
    hold this thought

Humans have an immaterial aspect to their being. (rewind effect to here)
Immaterial beings, by definition, exist without a body.
---
Humans have an aspect of their being that is not dependent upon a body.
If something is not dependent upon a body, it can continue to exist without a body.
--
Humans have an aspect of their being that can continue to exist without a body.
Death is loss of the physical body.
---
The immaterial human mind can continue to exist after physical, bodily death.
    hold this thought

A miracle is a supernatural event.
An event is supernatural if it displays some effect beyond what the natural order of secondary causes is capable of.
---
A miracle is an event displaying some effect beyond what the natural order of secondary causes is capable of.
God is capable of causing effects beyond what the natural order of secondary causes is cabaple of.
---
Miracles are possible in principle.
   hold this thought

(both from before)
Miracles are possible in principle.
The immaterial human mind can continue to exist after physical, bodily death.
---
Resurrection by supernatural miracle could be acheived by rejoining an immaterial human mind to its body.
    replace the previous two with this held thought

Humans struggle to be rational, often having their will overridden by their passions.
The rational arguments in favor of God's existence are complex.
---
Humans will struggle to discover and understand the rational arguments in favor of God's existence on their own.
Humans understand special revelation and teaching.
---
Special revelation is often necessary for humans to know God.
If God cares about human beings to some special degree, He would do what is necessary for them to know of Him.
---
If God cares about human beings to some special degree, it is reasonable that He would reveal himself to humans.
God cares about human beings to some special degree. (from before)
---
It is reasonable that God would reveal himself to humans.
There is material gain, and other incentives, for humans to falsely claim divine inspiration.
---
Any true revelation of God needs to be backed by some miracle only God is capable of performing, in order to be trusted.
Resurrection by supernatural miracle could be acheived by rejoining an immaterial human mind to its body. (from before)
---
Any revelation of God backed by resurrection from the dead is trustworthy.
    Hold this

If some religion understands God correctly (insert bullets), holds that resurrection of the body is possible, and backs its claims of divine revelation by reference to supernatural miracles, then that religion is true.
Islam, Judaism, and Christianity understand God correctly, hold that resurrection of the body is possible, and claim miracles as certification.
---
At least one of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity is true.
Islam's main miracle attestation is the Quran itself, which is not obviously actually only something doable by God.
---
Islam is unlikely to be true.
    animate rewind effect

At least one of -Islam-, Judaism, and Christianity is true.
Judiasm does not attest to any miracles that Christianity does not accept, so if there is a credible miracle in Christianity that is not in Judiasm, then Christianity is true.
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is historically credible.
---
Christianity is more "certified" by God than any other religion, and thus, the True Religion.

syllogisms leading to Catholicism

The True Bride of Christ is the branch of Christianity which:
1. was founded by Jesus Christ
2. has not abandoned or altered his teaching
3. was given his authority
4. has evidence of many miracles
5. cannot be destroyed
6. 

The doctrines of the Catholic Church are
  in accord with the words of the early church
  immutable
  logically coherent

  The doctrine of the eucharist, contraception, divorce, and biblical inerrancy all favor the Catholic Church.

The facts of history favor the Catholic Church
  rebellion
  continuity
  tradition
  miracles

=====
There are many branches of Christianity, which all hold mutually exclusive doctrines to be true.
Two branches which hold mutually exclusive doctrines, cannot both be correct.
---
There is at most one branch of Christianity which has correct doctrine.
Having correct doctrine is a prerequisite for being the One True Church of Christ.
---
There is at most one branch of Christianity which is the One True Church of Christ.
=====

=====
Heresy has the character of being a myopic simplification of a complex web of ideas into one single truth blown all out of proportion.
Upon examination, all Protestant denominations fit the simplification pattern of heresy.
---
All Protestant denominations are likely heretical.
Christians should not be a part of a heretical denomination.
---
Christians should not be a part of a Protestant denomination.
=====

=====
Christians hold that a man called Christ lived and died and lived again around the year 30.
The evidence for Christ's resurrection comes almost entirely from the testimony of the magesterium of the Catholic Church.
---
Christians believe in Christ's resurrection, based on the word of the magesterium of the Catholic Church.
It is irrational to believe something based on the evidence of an entity whose witness you do not trust.
---
To believe in Christ's resurrection, but to reject the magesterium of the Catholic Church is irrational.
To accept the magesterium of the Catholic Church is to become Catholic.
---
Christians should become Catholic to rationally believe in Christ's resurrection.
=====

=====
If a church was founded directly by Jesus Christ, then that church is the one true church of Christ.
Jesus Christ founded the Catholic Church in the year 33AD.
---
The Catholic Church is the one true church of Christ.
=====

=====
The one true church of Christ must not change its settled doctrines, for truth does not change.
The Catholic Church has not changed any settled doctrines.
---
The Catholic Church fits this criteria for being the one true bride of Christ.
=====

1. Christians are members of the Church, which was established by Jesus and his disciples.
2. The Church is the company of all Christians regarded as a spiritual body.
3. No spiritual body can function properly when its various members regard each other as false, or not a part of the body.
4. Thus if the Church is to function properly, its members must regard each other as a part of the same body.
5. Protestants and Catholics generally do not regard each other as part of the same body.
7. Thus if the Church is to function properly, Protestants and Catholics must merge to become one body.
8. If a group splits, where one side of the split does not want the split to occur, and the other does, then one side is the original, and the other is the rebel.
9. Protestants desired to establish their own, distinct body, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Protestants are the rebels.
10. Catholics desired to keep Protestants together, when the original split(s) occured. Thus, Catholics are the original.
11. When two groups merge, if one is the original, and one is the rebel, the rebel must submit to the original. This is called Repentance.
12. Thus, if Protestants and Catholics must merge, Protestants must submit to Catholics, in repentance.
13. By #7 and #12, if the Church is to function properly, Protestants must submit to Catholics in repentance.
14. All Protestants should desire the Church to function properly.
15. Thus all Protestants should join the Catholic Church.




===========================

Shorter clip scripts:

"A thing is composite if it is composed of more than one distinct part."

You disagree with this? Really? *sigh* This is basically just a definition of a term. The dictionary definition of "composite" is "made up of distinct parts or elements," so I don't think my definition is far off from common usage. I suppose you could object to the idea of "things" as real at all. You might say that nothing is actually composed of multiple parts, so nothing is actually composite. You might hold that the things that appear to be composite are actually not things, just an aggregate of individual parts which give the illusion of being a single "thing." But at that point you're left denying the existence of rocks and trees as real things in the world, against the great mass of human experience and use of language. Maybe you're right, but I think that position is so radical it's indistinguishable from absurdity.

"I am composed of more than one distinct part."

What is the hand if not a part of the body? What is the eye? Do we not all learn of the parts of the body? Even our constituent atoms have parts, else the atom could not be split. Further, there are (on the classical account of humanity) immaterial parts of a human substance, namely rationality. It is absurd to deny that humans are composed of parts.

"I am composite."

This follows directly from the previous two premises. If you accept the definition of composite, and accept that I (and really all humans) meet that definition, then it necessarily follows that "I am composite." Denying the conclusion while accepting the premises is irrational.

"A composite thing exists at any moment only insofar as its parts are combined at that moment."

This means that since a composite thing is composed of parts, then when those parts are not combined, that thing cannot be said to exist. I am a fully functional human right now, but if all my constituent parts are separated, I can hardly be said to still exist. Being chopped into pieces has the reliable effect of killing people. To have it's parts combined at any moment, is just what it means for a composite thing to exist.

"I exist at any moment only insofar as my parts are combined at that moment."

This follows directly from the previous two premises. If you accept the definition of a composite thing's existence, and accept that I am composite, then it necessarily follows that "I exist at any moment only insofar as my parts are combined at that moment." Denying the conclusion while accepting the premises is irrational.

"Two (or more) parts can be combined only where there is a concurrently combining cause."



"Potency and Act divide being in such a way that whatever is, is either pure act, or of necessity it is composed of potency and act as primary and intrinsic principles."

As a little aside, this line is the first of the 24 thomistic theses, which are a collection of propositions which define the Thomist philosophical system. But let's try to explain what this little bit of jargon means.
Potency means the potential ways a thing might exist. I might exist in a standing or sitting position, as opposed to an unassisted flight which is not a way that I might exist. Standing is a potency I have whereas flying is not.
Act mean the actual way a thing exists. Right now I actually am sitting. My potential for sitting has been actualized. I am in the "act" of sitting.
Thus when we say that "Potency and Act divide being" we mean that there are only two kinds of existence: potential existence and actual existence. These kinds of existence stand in contrast to true nothingness or non-being. Nothingness is hard to really conceptualize. It is not just "empty space" since space itself is a kind of actual existence. Nothingness is more like a round square. It is something that truly just means nothing, and cannot even in principle have any kind of existence.
How do we know that Potency and Act are our only choices? Well, we know Act is real, since that's basically what it means: "what is fully real right now." And we know that what is real now was not always real, and will not always be real in the future. Basically, we know that things change. But if things change, we need to explain how the things that will become actualized can happen, for if they fully do not exist at all before they are actualized then we must say that they come from nothing or non-being, which is absurd. From nothing, nothing can come. This means that these changes must exist in some real way already, before they are actualized, and this state of being we call "potential." Potential being comprises everything that *could* exist, even if it does not currently exist, and never in fact comes to exist. Because of this, it is impossible that there is any "room" so to speak for any modes of being beyond Act and Potency.
