If something is made of multiple parts, then it is composite.
I am made of multiple parts.
---
I am composite.
Composite things only exist at any moment that their parts are combined.
---
I only exist at any moment that my parts are combined.
In order for parts to be combined, there must be a cause keeping them combined.
---
I only exist at any moment because a cause keeps my parts combined.
Something that only exists because a cause keeps its parts combined is "being caused to exist."
---
I am being caused to exist.
Causes are either made of multiple parts, or made of only one part.
    --> rephrase to "Causes are either composite, or simple."
---
I am either being caused to exist by composite causes, or by a simple cause.
Anything that is simple (made of only one part) we will call God.
---
I am either being caused to exist by composite causes, or by God.
    --> if you think you're being caused to exist by a simple cause, called God, then you think God exists. So let's drop that part and assume you do not think you are being caused to exist directly by God.

I am being caused to exist by composite causes.
A cause that is composite only exists while a cause keeps its parts combined.
---
I am being caused to exist by composite causes, which themselves only exist while a cause keeps their parts combined.
When A causes B which causes C, C is caused by a *causal chain.*
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain [at any single moment that I exist]. (we're adding "at any single moment that I exist" here for clarification, because if you remember at the beginning we were saying things like "I only exist at any moment that my parts are combined." We are only considering a single moment in time and explaining how I could exist at that particular moment)
A causal chain is *chronological* if it occurs over some series of moments.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that is not chronological at any single moment that I exist.
  that doesn't help, lets try again (do a rewind effect)

I am being caused to exist by a causal chain at any single moment that I exist.
A causal chain is *hierarchical* if it is composed of a series of causes acting all in one moment.
---
I am being caused to exist by a hierarchical causal chain.
A hierarchical causal chain must have a beginning.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that has a beginning.
The beginning of this causal chain must be a simple cause (non-composite cause), since any composite cause requires a further cause.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain that begins with a simple cause.
Anything that is simple (made of only one part) we will call God.
---
I am being caused to exist by a causal chain which begins with God.
If a causal chain beginning with God exists, then God exists.
---
THUS
God exists.


PREMISE DEFENSES:

"I am made of multiple parts"

Come on.

===
"Composite things only exist at any moment that their parts are combined."

This follows if we consider the contrary. What happens when the parts of a composite thing are separated? That thing no longer exists. Separating all the parts of my body from each other would be thorough way of ensuring that I do not exist.

In classical theism, and Catholicism more specifically, one of the attributes of God is "divine simplicity." Wikipedia says "the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is without parts." It also says "Varieties of the doctrine may be found in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism, though the doctrine's origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus' Enneads as the Simplex." So, we can see that this idea of God existing without parts is not some arbitrary idea I came up with to make this proof work, but rather a long and widely held essential idea to understanding what God actually is. Is there more we can say about God than that he is absolutely simple? Of course. But analyzing and understanding the full nature and attributes of God is a lifetime's worth of work, so for now we'll try to keep it /simple/.

Another name for this kind of causal chain is a "per se" causal chain. An example of a hierarchical causal chain is when a book rests on a shelf, which rests on a wall, which rests on the earth. The book is held up by the shelf, but only instrumentally, since without the earth as the ultimate base, there is nothing holding the chaing up. The key feature of such causal chains is that each element in the chain gets its causal power instrumentally from the previous element. Why do we say this occurs all in one moment? Well, at any given moment in time, the book is only held up as long as the other causal elements act at that moment to hold it up. If a causal chain happens all in one instant, thenit must be hierarchical since each element would be recieving its causal power instrumentally as opposed to inherently.
